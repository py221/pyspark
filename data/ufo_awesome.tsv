The witness proceeds to drive many more miles toward the town of Cordova, when the witness becomes aware of two large, disc-shaped objects sitting in a meadow beside the roadway.  The witness calls the next morning, and is quite emotionally upset by the experience.  Reports that the event was quite dramatic.

19950722	19950723	 Santa Clara, CA		30 min.	Mr. Peter Davenport National UFO Reporting CenterPO Box 45623, University StationSeattle, WA 98145Dear Peter,Along with my report, I have enclosed a hand-written report from Ben Kwong who witnessed the same UFO&apos;s with me on Saturday, July 22, 1995.  Mr. Kwong is an engineer and lives in San Jose.  I did not get a written report from his 12-year-old son, Michael, but will send it to you if he writes one.  I believe that the reports from Mr. Kwong and myself should be thorough enough.  The only difficulty in writing our reports would be regarding the order in which we saw everything happen.  This is due to the fact that we saw up to five UFO&apos;s (four to five in the air at once).  We were not always looking at the same UFO at the same time.  Since there were several UFO&apos;s in the sky at once during our sighting, we didn&apos;t always focus on the same UFO&apos;s.  Anyway, the following is my accounting of what we saw.  Also, please note that I may have incorrectly given you the time of the sighting as being between 10:30 AM and 11:00 to 11:15.  The time was between 9:30 AM to 10:00 or later.  It was definitely for at least a half hour, maybe an hour (I began teaching my tennis lesson at 9:00 and noticed the first UFO at about 9:30.  When I arrived at home, 2 min. away, it was about 11:00 but I don&apos;t recall watching the UFO&apos;s for more than 45 min. to an hour at the very most -very minimum was a half hour).To whom it may concern:On Saturday, July 22, 1995 at 9:30 AM I, along with Michael Kwong (age 12), and his father (Ben Kwong), had a UFO&apos;s sighting which lasted for at least a half hour (to 10:15 AM or later) over the sky of Santa Clara, CA, from the Marina Playa Apt. complex tennis courts located at 3500 Granada Ave. and Lawrence Expressway (El Camino is a close cross street of Lawrence Expressway).  The sighting first began at 9:30 AM when I was teaching Michael Kwong a tennis lesson.  Michael was practicing his serve and was tossing the ball in the air.  I looked at the ball toss as it went up and noticed that the moon was out.  I also noticed an object by the moon which I took to be a star and appeared stationary like a star.  I looked at the object again and thought it might be moving slowly.  The object appeared to be moving slowly at a very high altitude, perhaps just within the atmosphere or at least at a very high altitude.  I spoke to Michael and began to say things out loud like, &quot;What is that?  What the heck is that?  It&apos;s not an airplane.&quot;  Michael looked up at it as well.  I stopped the lesson out of curiosity to watch this object.  I walked over to the fence and yelled to Ben Kwong, who was sitting in his car reading the newspaper.  I asked him to come out of his car to get a look a the object so we could figure out what it was.  He stood down below the tennis courts, looking up at the object as I and Michael were too.  Then Mr. Kwong came up to the court and all three of us continued to watch the object.  The object looked completely round and whitish in appearance (perhaps due to the altitude or even entering the atmosphere?).  The object slowly moved away from the moon and then curved a slowly headed back toward its original position, and then it appeared to hover and then start to move slowly again.  We watched this object for a few minutes and then we saw another object which looked had the same appearance as the first object.  I don&apos;t remember if Mr. Kwong or I spotted the next object first (Mr. Kwong&apos;s son is near sighted, so he had a harder time seeing).  I believe we watched until finally we saw at least four of the whitish objects in the sky.  At one point it appeared like they were hovering and moving slowly in four corners of the sky.  When they were closer to us, they appeared metallic, sort of a metallic, silver to silver-blue in color.  When they were higher up they initially appeared to be more whitish in color.  Anyway, we continued watching several of these objects as they moved slowly, stop, and move in bizarre paths, unlike airplanes.  They were very high but left no exhaust trail.  They moved and changed direction, unlike weather balloons or satellites.  At some point, after watching the (I&apos;ll call them silver, or metallic-silver/blue) objects, Ben and I noticed a red UFO, completely round like the others, but a metallic-red in color.  We then both observed a silver UFO and the red UFO in a staggered formation, with the silver UFO leading in front to the left of the red UFO (doing what appeared to be the same speed).  We noticed another red object at a lower altitude slowly moving up into the sky (not metallic, but more of an all orange to orange-red in color).  I didn&apos;t, nor did Ben, take much notice of this object as it slowly went up into the sky.  It could have been a balloon and didn&apos;t have the metallic look of the other objects which were very high in the sky.  At some point, the silver UFO&apos;s would just disappear from sight.  I don&apos;t know where they went, maybe out into the upper atmosphere,  Then sometimes one would come back into view.  The red UFO really caught my attention next.  Ben had lost sight of it (you really had to &quot;track&quot; with your eyes without looking away from the UFO&apos;s or it would take a few seconds to find some of them again).  Anyway, I told Ben that I could see the red UFO again.  I saw it moving very slowly up in the sky and then it suddenly shot through the sky at an amazing speed.  I said, &quot; There it goes! There it goes! Look at it go!&quot;  Ben kept saying that he couldn&apos;t find it.  We watched some of the other UFO&apos;s until it seemed that there were no more to see (they had all gone, but we didn&apos;t see them leave).  We had about given up on seeing any more UFO&apos;s up there when I caught sight of the first or perhaps another red UFO.  I told Ben to look up as I pointed to its location.  Ben said he could see it.  Suddenly the red UFO shot across the sky at an amazing speed, much much faster than any jet or rocket could fly (we were watching regular passenger jets crawl across the sky every once in awhile as we watched the UFO&apos;s.  The passenger jets, and some jets which may have been military from Moffet Field, were at a much lower altitude than the UFO&apos;s, a testimony to the speed of the UFO&apos;s).  I kept pointing at the red UFO as it sped across the sky.  We were both in awe, and were both speaking out loud in our amazement of the speed of the object (&quot;There is no way that can be a jet.  Nothing is that fast.  Look at it go.&quot; -etc., etc.).  As I was moving my finger across the sky, tracking the object (in what would take a jet several minutes to travel, I followed the object across the sky in less than ten seconds.  It was still at a very high altitude as well), Ben said he could see a silver UFO right next to the red one.  I said I only could see the red one, but just before the red UFO completely went out of sight, I could see another UFO, a silver one, very close to the red UFO or joined to it.  We were then completely convinced that we saw UFO&apos;s, things which are not man-made.  We didn&apos;t see any more UFO&apos;s for a few minutes, so I resumed my tennis lesson, although I had a very hard time teaching.  We stopped a few minutes later.  I looked up again and saw one lone silver UFO (up so high that it appeared white).  It was hovering and then started to move slowly again.  I told Ben and Michael that there was another one up there.  At this point, we already saw the most exciting part of our sighting (the red UFO &amp; silver UFO shooting off).  Our necks were tired from the strain of looking up, almost straight up at times for over a half hour (possibly an hour or more, as Ben stated, although I can&apos;t be sure).  We really didn&apos;t take much notice of this UFO and we didn&apos;t see it disappear from sight, but it did a couple of minutes later.  We parted between 10:30 and 11:00 AM.  I went back to my apartment and called some TV stations to see if anyone had reported anything (I really thought SOMEONE would have witnessed what we saw and would report it.  The TV station personnel said nobody else called in, plus they seemed rather skeptical of my story.  That annoyed me a bit.  I then called the Air Force in Santa Clara County.  They switched me from command post to command post.  I gave my story up to three times perhaps.  They asked me at what time I saw the UFO&apos;s, took my story, and then said they would transfer me to another command post and to just tell them the same thing (that I told the first people I contacted).  Finally, the Air Force gave me the phone # of the National UFO Reporting Agency (for whom I am writing this report).  I, after giving my story to Peter Davenport, was made aware of the fact that another person in California reported seeing up to five UFO&apos;s on the same day I had my sighting.  This was my first time every seeing anything like this in my life (I&apos;m 29-years-old, teach tennis and am also a computer specialist teaching elementary school.  Ben, like I said, is an engineer.  So I believe we are both credible people).End of ReportI&apos;m waiting to get my grandmother&apos;s written report of her two sightings and my mother&apos;s report of a sighting (these all happened many years ago).  I was afraid to mention their sightings because I thought it might make my sighting less credible.  I indeed immediately felt I had something to share with them and also wanted them to retell of their sightings as well.  My grandmother&apos;s sightings are of particular interest to me since she saw a UFO in the Almaden area of San Jose, CA some 58 years ago.  I teach in this area and my ancestors first settled there in the 1860&apos;s.  Someone emailed me who lives in Almaden to tell me she and her daughter &amp; 14-year-old son had sightings in Almaden.  She said that her son saw one hovering over the school that I teach at.  This was before she even knew that I teach at this school!  Anyway, I don&apos;t know how many people you can believe on the Internet re. sightings, but I know what I saw, and that&apos;s good enough for me.  The only other strange thing I observed in my life was described to me by someone on the Internet as being &quot;ball lightening&quot; or something like it.  I was twelve-years-old at the time.  I don&apos;t know if that is UFO related or not.  Is it just a normal phenomenon.  It happened indoors.  It went under a cot.  The cot shot straight up in the air, about five feet, and there was nothing underneath the cot!  The object was indefinable in shape, just grayish/white, and swirling.  It seemed to react to me as I entered the room and skimmed across the floor.  Any ideas?Sincerely,William D. Baileywbailey@cello.gina.calstate.edu

Sheriff had received many credible reports about red and blue &quot;roman candle&quot; like objects shooting down out of the sky to the ground.  Then witnesses observed a large red cluster in sky, then two bright clusters.  The latter appeared to explode, and then fall to earth.  One red object appeared to be the largest; green ones were smaller.  They were reported to appear to be descending to the earth slowly, at which point a huge white flash of light occurred. Subsequent reports by investigators suggest that some kind(s) of officials were in the area shortly after event, requesting that local and state officials say nothing.((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, this event was not only dramatic, but quite bizarre, as well.  We were first contacted Saturday night, January 7, 1995, by an Operations Officer in TEMA, who reported to us that the event had occurred, and that their offices had been activated, as a result of the strange event, and subsequent explosion.  The latter was so dramatic that a member of the local aviation community, who had witnessed the event, immediately following the explosion, drove to the airport and took off in an aircraft to search for what he was certain had been an airliner that had exploded in midair.  TEMA contacted the U. S. Air Force, apparently informing them that a possible UFO event had occurred, and inquiring what TEMA should do.  According to the TEMA official we spoke with, TEMA was informed by the USAF to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.  TEMA did contact our Center by telephone, and faxed to our offices a seven-page document, written by a Warren County Deputy Sheriff, in which that officer describeded the explosion, according to eyewitnesses. We express our sincere gratitude to TEMA for their effort in sharing the information with our Center. Peter Davenport, Director))

(eastern), she was riding the Staten Island Ferry from the tip of Manhattan to Staten Island.  Just as the ferry was passing Governor&apos;s Island, she became aware of a commotion on the east side of the ferry boat.  People were rushing to that side of the ferry, shouting, pointing, and generally raising a ruckus.  She decided to try to determine was the cause of the disturbance, and walked outside onto the passenger deck.  What she saw shocked her.  The object was huge, and it obscured the passengers&apos; view of Governor&apos;s Island.  Many of them reported that the object looked like a city, with lights and a skyline.  However, its presence apparently roiled the water beneath it, causing a froth to appear on the water&apos;s surface!! For days afterward, the witnessed handed out leaflets at the ferry terminal, hoping to contact other passengers who had seen the object.  Those same people approached 9-1-1 facilities, requesting copies of the tape recorded reports of the object, which was also seen from Governor&apos;s Island, but the tapes were either missing, or not made available, they were told. A video tape about the incident was prepared, a copy of which is in the possession of NUFORC. This incident apparently was VERY dramatic, and it was witnessed by dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of people.  We would be most grateful if anyone else who was present that night would please submit a report about what they saw that night.

I&apos;m not sure what you want but I&apos;ll give you a few details:My fiance&apos; and I were driving down Route 3 East in Virginia, I think we had passed Route 301, and were heading towards Colonial Beach.  This was Sunday, August 20 1995, at 1345 EST.  We both saw a bright reflection in the sky, the sun was reflecting off of it and we thought it was an airplane.  I guess it turned a little because the brightness stopped.  We both watched for a few seconds, and noticed it didn&apos;t have any wings or tail like an airplane would have.  It was cigar shaped, (it looked like a 747 w/o wings or a tail).  All of a sudden it was gone!  I looked down at the road for a second (I was driving), looked back up and couldn&apos;t find it.  My fiance&apos; said it just disappeared!Please let me know if any other sightings were reported on the East Coast this weekend.  Was I seeing things?  I&apos;ve always believed in UFO&apos;s but I never thought I&apos;d see one!                                   ((name and address deleted))

19951108	19951108	 Pilot Rock, OR	 light	1 hr.	Two brothers were returning to Pendleton, OR, and Dixie, WA, after hunting in Oregon.  Upon approaching Pilot Rock, OR, the brother driving the lead vehicle, a Suzuki (Samurai?) noticed a peculiar cluster of blue-white colored round lights, positioned in a square or rectangular pattern, ahead.  He called his brother on CB radio (Ch. 4) to ask is he saw it, and the brother answered that he certainly did.  The lights disappeared from sight, then reappeared on the other side of the road.  They passed through Pilot Rock, and the object became visible again as they were leaving that town.  The object had the same appearance as it had had before they arrived at Pilot Rock, and it stayed with them (according to their conscious recollection, for another 30 minutes. The brothers made several interesting observations at the time of the incident.  Most interesting was the fact that even though they were talking over a CB channel that traditionally is used very heavily by loggers, and other users in that area of Oregon (Ch. 4), they heard no other users during the entire experience!  Also, they saw no other traffic on their side of the highway,. even though they remember seeing oncoming traffic in the other lane.  When they got home, they topped off the fuel tanks in their trucks.  Craig&apos;s vehicle indicated that he had driven 98.7 miles from deer camp, where both he and his brother had filled their vehicles&apos; fuel tanks from fuel cans.  When they got to Pendleton, his vehicle, which was getting about 25 miles per gallon, took less than 2 gallons of fuel!Craig had spent 9 years in the military, during which time, he said, he had seen many different types of weapons used.  This aerial event, or object, was like nothing he had ever seen before, he said.

When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tail&quot;fired&quot; twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen.

19961120	19961204	 North Port, FL		8 min.	A man was outside his home for a last smoke and to walk his dog, before going to bed. He looked at the night sky to the southwest, because that is the direction where there is no treeline, and he suddenly noticed a light, which at first he thought might be a star, although it appeared to him to be rather large to be a star. When he looked back at a a couple of minutes later, it was now larger than a full moon!  Also, it appeared to be getting closer to him, and was lower to the horizon, he thought.  Then he realized that it had become two distinct lights, both bright white.  At this point, he summoned his wife, who also saw the object as it passed directly overhead.  they both agreed it was less that 500 feet above them. It was not a helicopter, and it was too slow for an aircraft.  The two lights were on the bottom, and they were glowing.  They could see an outline of the object as it passed overhead, and it appeared to be &quot;pie-shaped.&quot; They both heard a really low hum as the object passed overhead very slowly.  The object suddenly disappeared approximately 2 seconds after it had passed overhead.  The caller added that he and his wife have three cats, one of which is an &quot;outside&quot; cat, and two that are &quot;indoor&quot; cats.  After the incident, all of the them were gone, and they did not return until approximately one week later. Their dog, which normally is very eager to go outside, would not go outside for several days without coaxing from his owner.  The dog, a pit bull (?) was apparently very upset for several days afterward.  At 2315 hrs. that night, after the sighting, the dog started barking and snapping at the front door, and he would not go through that door for 4-5 days.

19970404	19970404	 Winsted, CT		5 sec.	The caller went outside to walk his dog and look at the comet. He looked to the east, and he noticed movement in the night sky.  Upon looking closely at the object, he noticed that it was 7-9 lights (est.), oriented in a &quot;boomerang&quot; shape.  The lights were orange in color, and they were very faint, fainter than typical stars, for example. The object moved very fast from the eastern sky to the northwest sky, traversing approximately 120-130 degrees (est.) of arc in approximately 5 seconds.  No sound was apparent.The caller does not have internet access.

19960920	19970206	 Cancun (Melia Turquesa Hotel) (Mexico),	 light	4-5 seconds	SUMMARY:  3 dull orange lights closely clustered traveling from NNW to SSE. Traveling at high altitude &amp; rate of speed with a abrupt jog to the east directly above then continuing SSE.After some showers, clear evening sky to the North, high broken skies to the South East.Sitting on sixth floor veranda, nearest to the beach, lights in courtyard had been turned off.Wife and I were sky browsing when my peripheral vision picked up some rapid movement to the NorthEast. The object, which looked like 3 dull orange lights close together, moved very rapidily from10:00 to 2:00 with a slight jog to the East at 12:00. Its speed was faster than an aircraft, and had no other lights. We lost sight of this object over the clouds to the South East.The skies were crystal clear with the exception of the high clouds to the South East.I am a Director of Electronics and have been in the industry for 30+ years. Served a brief stint in the Navy flying in P5M&apos;s in the mid 60&apos;s in Vietnam.My wife is a business office manager in the hospital field for the past 25+ years.

19961115	19961123	 Blossburg, PA		30 sec.	The caller, a senior member of the military (ret./artillery), together with another observer, had witnessed a very peculiar sight in the night sky to the north of his location. The observer was located approximately 20 miles south of the NY/PA state line10 miles south of Mansfield, and 6 miles south of the intersection of U.S. Routes #15 and #6. He saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner, with normal navigation lights, flying from the northern sky to the southeast with a round, bright orange ball of light about &quot;200 mils&quot; (approx 7 degrees arc) in front of the aircraft!  The object was approximately &quot;10 mils&quot; (approx. 20 arc minutes) in diameter.The type of aircraft he witnessed was unknown to him, but he felt certain it was a commercial type a/c.  It had &quot;blue and red lights&quot; (sic) on it. He commented that the crew of the aircraft MUST have seen the object, which he thought was probably directly ahead of the aircraft.  The object was NOT a meteor, the observer reported.  It was moving across the sky in a methodical fashion, at a seemingly steady pace.  It was certainly not streaking.   Neither object made any noise, which struck the observer as being very strange. He did not hear any jet noise whatever, even though the object passed directly overhead of his position.
19960322	19960323	 Houston, TX		10 sec.	Caller first called at 2153 hrs. on Friday, 22MR96, and left a message. He was standing outside to look for the comet, when he noticed a V-shaped formation of points of light almost directly overhead.  Eadh &quot;wing&quot; of the &quot;V&quot; consisted of approximately 10 objects, each about the size of a small star.  Each side of the &quot;V&quot; was swept about 10 degrees behind the straight line oriented perpendicular to the line of flight of the formation. The formation had a very high angular velocity, and the observers estimate was that they were moving at a very high speed.  He stated that they looked like a formation of jet fighters, but there was no sound.  The formation was moving faster than a formation of fighters would have been moving.  The observer watched them pass through approximately 15 degrees of arc, moving from west to east--toward the lights of Houston to the east of his position--when they disappeared from his sight because of the brightness of the ambient light.

19970107	19970108	 Amelia, OH	 light	5 min.	SUMMARY:  We saw a large &quot;spotlight&quot; at about 100-150 ft directly above us. It had one flashing red light above the spotlight and two white lights to each side of the object (4 total). Then another light appeared out of nowhere behind the first one. This one looked to be the same as the other. We quickly sped away in the car to his house about 500 meters away. When we got out of the car the first one was still directly above us as if it backed up to follow us. The object made no sound at all, even though it was so low to the ground.It was dark out. It was in a residential area so there were houses and trees around. The object was rather large (bigger than any plane around here) We saw two of them, one was REALLY close the other was about 100 meters behind the other. Both of them were hovering. They were both dark in color, either black or gray. The &quot;spotlights&quot; were very bright.
19951213	19951214	 Upper Makefield, PA		30 sec.	Two young girls were driving near their neighborhood, when they noticed extremely bright lights above their car.  The lights were bright white, and appeared to be &quot;turning.&quot;  Suddenly, they turned blue, and just disappeared.  The father of one of the two girls called the hotline.  He reported the incident, and added that he had called his neighbor to ask whether he had seen the lights.  The neighbor said that he had not, but that his dogs had been actually skrieking in a most unusual fashion, until the power at their house suddenly failed, at which time the dogs walked into the house as if nothing had occured.  The father reported that there had been a sighting in his area 17 years earlier.

19961107	19961207	 Seattle, WA	 sphere	7 sec.	SUMMARY:  Dimly lit group of colored objects hovering over the Woodland Park Zoo emitting light beams similar to spotlights.I was walking my dogs with a friend in the park adjacent to the zoo; it was a lull in the heavy rain.  We walked into a parking lot to use the tunnel on the way home.   As we emerged from the trees my friend pointed upwards.  Just above the zoo, 400 yards from the parking lot were the four shapes in the sky:  two faint blue spheres moving back and forth like in vibration as a pair.  Closer to us was a cylindrical object the same width of the spheres, and length three times the diameter (1x3), emitting a rose colored tint.  The closest object was a larger sphere emitting a deep maroon glow.  The three (four) objects hovered back and forth independently, while their lights seemed to engulf them and be focused towards the ground at the same time.  After a few second of looking at these objects and being in awe the purple sphere became bright to the point neither of us could look any longer and were forced to look down.  When I looked up again there was nothing.  My friend then saw nothing. My dogs did not seem to notice anything.

He saw a pale yellow light to the southeast of tower.  It looked somewhat square, although he could not be sure that he had had a good look at it.  The object passed directly overhead of his position, at which time he noted that it was dropping something off of it.  He thought the object might have been something conventional, like a flare suspended from a balloon.  He called the Walla Walla Police Department and reported it, I believe he reported.

19961025	19961101	 Laurel, MD		25 sec.	Caller was entering Highway I-95 (southbound) in Laurel, Maryland, when he noticed two round objects sitting still in the sky.  At first, he thought they were the type of colored spheres mounted on telephone lines to make the lines visible to pilots.  His impression was that the objects were perhaps 1 or 2 miles from him, and perhaps 1/4 mile above ground level, and maybe 200 yards from one another. (He saw a commercial jet in the distance, apparently leaving Baltimore airport or Andrews AFB, so he had something to compare with the objects he was observing.)The color of the objects was that of pencil lead, perhaps with a bit of copper-colored tinge to them.  They were generally round, but they were slightly out of round at the equator.The object just moved  out of sight rapidly, in approximately one second!  They just STREAKED.Caller called Laurel, MD, police, but they said it was a matter for Arundel Co. sheriff&apos;s office.  Sheriff&apos;s office said it was a matter for the state police.  Then he called Andrews AFB, and they said they had nothing

Suddenly, a second identical object raced up to the first, and both objects proceeded to move in a westerly direction.  At first, the observer thought the objects might be seagulls, since they have them on Moses Lake.  But the flight of the objects was unlike that of birds--there were no wings on it, nothing was flapping, and the flight was very smooth. His father had seen something very similar about a week earlier, he thought on 06JN96. The two objects parted, rose in altitude, veered together, then disappeared.

The object had rows of very bright lights (on the side?), and it had &quot;rainbow light&quot; in the center. the caller got a very good look at the back end of the craft.  It seemed to have a very small &quot;afterburner&quot; on the trailing edge, which was round.
19970206	19970212	 Coober Pedy, S.A. (Approx. 250km south of) (Australia),	 light		SUMMARY:  A stormy night on the Stuart Highway. Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking.The first event to happen was the sighting of a &apos;roadwork&apos; man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this &apos;star&apos; was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn&apos;t be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn&apos;t talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a &apos;supernatural&apos; kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star. I am 18.I am not providing my address as yet for security reasons - as well as I only connected to the net yesterday and haven&apos;t bothered yet to set up an e-mail address on my computer. I will watch this site for further information.I have provided this report because I know how hard it is to gain information on these matters. As well as in the interests of &apos;science&apos;.I hope you make some use of this report.

It appeared to him to be a blend of red, blue, and bright white in color.  It left no trail in the sky the way he would expect a meteor or a burning aircraft to do.  The caller was looking to the northwest when he observed the object, and he estimated its angle of elevation above the horizontal plane at &quot;38 degrees.&quot;  He added that he is &quot;a pilot,&quot; and that he estimated its speed at not less than Mach 3.  He called again at 2230 hours to report that he had seem the same thing at 2230 hours!  It had gone directly over his head, and it was traveling to the northwest at a very high rate of speed.  He estimated its size as bigger than a nickel held at arm&apos;s length.He volunteered that &quot;something is awry?&quot;

Suddenly, the wife, who was in the passenger&apos;s seat, observed a large, bright, white light in the left portion of the windshield.  It was much brighter than a helicopter light, and had a steady glow to it.  At first, she said nothing to her husband, but when it disappeared from her sight behind some cypress trees, and then was visible again after their car had passed them, she realized the object was probably not an aircraft, and it was not a reflection off a side window. Suddenly, the object developed a green or blue tail, and it accelerated very rapidly, disappearing from their sight.   The object was moving generally from the southwest to the northwest.
19961124	19961124	 Bismarck, ND		60 sec.	The caller noticed a small, circular, orange object, apparently hovering in the night sky to the south of the National Weather Service offices. The color of the object reminded the observer of the color of the orange flame at the bottom of the space shuttle when it is launched. The object was 65-70 degrees off the horizon, and it was larger than any of the stars in the sky, although smaller than the moon. He said that if a person were looking at the sky, he could not fail to miss it.

19961229	19961229	 Bastrop, LA	 light	1 hour	SUMMARY:  due south of bastropA bright light was seen in the sky, and was thought to be a star until it started moving.  It moved back and forth, and up and down.  Sometimes it climbed in a diagonal course. The object also changed colors.  It went from blue to redto green. Later, WE briefly saw the same object again, but in a different part of sky.  I often look for such objects, but I&apos;ve never seen anything quiet like this.
19871220	19970119	 Las Vegas (60-70 miles north-east of, Interstate 15 North), NV	 light	3 - 4 minutes	SUMMARY:  Viewed pairs of red strobing lights extended across wide area of Nevada desert and watched as two F-15 fighter aircraft tried to intercept light formation.On December 20, 1989 I and two co-workers were on our way to Aspen,CO. We were driving a 24Ft. rental truck loaded with items for our employer&apos;s winter home.We were approximately 60-70 miles north-east of Las Vegas when we heard cargo in the rear of the truck shift. I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects. This was truly a hair-raising experience for all of us and we did not waste any time in exiting the area.

19960131	19970121	 Buckhead Ridge, FL	 light	5 min 30 sec	SUMMARY:  I observed an object apparently making a controlled reentry or entry into the atmosphere.  It was the size of a medium sized star and  fairly far away.The object caught my attention by leaving a bright yellow and orange trail down toward earth at about an attitude of 40 degrees above the horizon which lasted for about 20-30 seconds before it disappeared from the highest point of origin to the lowest.  It was round and tiny like a medium magnitude star and appeared at the time of the orange trail&apos;s disappearance and proceeded to move about directly East and perfectly parallel to the horizon, not appearing to lose any altitude at all.  I noted the time at the initial observation and it travelled eastward for 5 minutes before it disappeared over some high cirrus or haze.It appeared to be NNW of me,  perhaps over Orlando around a hundred miles away.I checked and there were no shuttles up that night.  I am a private pilot, a scientist and a weather spotter, with a degrees in Psychology and Education as well as having been recognized by Who&apos;s Who for outstanding career achievement.  I was advised to record this for posterity.

A pilot and his 1st officer in a Beechcraft 1900 with passengers, while flying at 16,000 feet between layers of solid overcast 90 miles southeast of Saginaw, MI, suddenly see a large, bizarre ball of light appear in front of them.  They both thought it was another aircraft and were concerned that it might collide with them, so they turned on their identification lights and initiated a turn.  The object apparently was capable of &quot;jumping&quot; suddenly, perhaps as much as 20 or 30 miles within 1 second time.  The crew requested clearance to descend, which they did.  they descended to 9500 feet, but the object appeared to descend with them, staying on their now, &quot;12:00&quot; position.  They continued their descent to 3,500 feet, where they entered the clouds. Another airliner, a Northwest commuter (Callsign: &quot;Masaba&quot;) witnessed the interaction.  Multiple conversations occured with Cleveland Center and Saginaw Approach about the incident. The crew borrowed a still camera from one of the passengers, and attempted to photograph the object.  The camera and film were returned to the passenger after the photograph had been taken. Copy of radio communication requested 04MR96 under FOIA.

They were moving relative to one another.  They exhibited no landing or marker lights. Then, one at a time, they began to ascend, and they went through the overcast, or clouds (?).  Other individuals called his radio station and stated that they, too, had seen the objects.

It was dark out but the lights from the school lit up the playground.  Corn fields were on 3 sides of the school and a street to the other.  We were sitting and talk when suddenly the silence behind us stoped.  We herd a soft humming like the sound the comes from one of those green power boxes (the big ones with the large hinges)   Then a large triangular shaped object came from behind us (to the south).  It was about 100 ft.off the ground.  It had yellow flashing lights on each point.  It stayed above us for about 2-3 mins then rapidly accelarated back to the south over a mountain. After it burst away a very bright light shone for about a half a second.

19970101	19970101	 Clatonia, NE		10 min.	Woman called to report that she had been driving west on an east-west runninbg highway with her daughter (age 9 yrs.), when they both noticed an &quot;aircraft&quot; with 3x blinking lights on it, located about 1 mile east of the town of Clatonia.  The light on the &quot;south part&quot; of the craft was blue, the light on the bottom was very bright red, and the light on the north side was white. The caller stopped her car before she passed underneath it, rolled her window down, and looked up at it.  She heard nothing, no sound whatever. She then drove on to the next intersection, turned her car around, hoping to see whether the object had left. It was then that she and her daughter witnessed a second object near the first, then a third and a fourth on the opposite side of the highway from the first, and very low to the ground.  Even though there was low ground fog, they could see the objects distinctly.  They saw a fifth object shortly afterward, at which point they decided to drive into town.  As they drove toward Clatonia, they saw another object come out of the fog. She called Columbus, NE, airport, where she learned that they had had no aircraft in the area at that time.  They also told her that they had a radar &quot;shadow&quot; in the area where her sighting had taken place

19930209	19970116	 Lufkin, TX	 delta	5-7 min.	SUMMARY:  Family traveling home along a rural farm road spotted unusual lights/object in the sky moving slowly from east to west and pulled over to investigate.As we were traveling home along a rural farm road we spotted an unusual light in the sky moving slowly toward the road from east to west.  It didn&apos;t move like any familiar airplane, so we pulled over to watch for a minute.  The object was shaped similar to a Stealth, except with a thinner, smoother head-on profile, and with much more bluntly squared-off wingtips and nose.  It moved extremely slowly, no faster than a motorized hangglider,  and completely without engine noise, although it was at a relatively low altitude. (below low-hanging clouds.)  As it passed over our vehicle, its span covered the length of the Suburban.  It had a very large white spotlight at its nose and two bright lights at each wingtip.  The underside had many patterned rows of small colored lights, with an amber double row down the center.  The underside gave the impression of being textured or plated.  There was absolutely no engine noise, even though the craft was very low and very slow.  After pass!ing overhead, two or three small, blue &quot;sparkles&quot; dropped from the craft.  Not quite believing what we had witnessed, and not being fervent UFO watchers, we decided not to report the sighting. Witnesses were myself, a high school library director, my husband, an industrial chemist, and my 15-yr-old son.
19960603	19960611	 Oglethorpe, GA		30 min.	MUFON State Director relays report: A group of 13 adult witnesses observe a large craft, decribed as a &quot;large box in the air.&quot;  The object looked like two terrapin shells attached at their edges, and tapering in the back.  The upper shell was dark, flat, slate gray; the other was beige.  The object was estimated to be approximately 50&apos; long and 30&apos; wide.  It was estimated to be 20x the diameter of the moon, viewed from the observers&apos; vantage point. The object was lit on the interior, and the observers could look into the lighted interior.  It did not hurt the observers&apos; eyes to look at the object.  The object was turning around its vertical axis at approximately 1 revolution per second.  It was fairly low in the sky, perhaps 1,000 feet, estimated by the observers, and it was moving from the northwest to the southwest.
19960322	19960322	 Meridian, MS		20 sec.	Caller was driving east on I-20, and at Mile Marker #120, he observed a silver-colored, metallic-appearing, &quot;opal shaped&quot; object in the sky.  It was 15 degrees to the draver&apos;s right, and 30 degrees above the horizontal, and it was hovering totally motionless.  The object clearly appeared to be rotating, and it occasionally would reflect sunlight, as if it had a flat side on it.  The observer pulled off the highway and stopped.  As he was watching it, the object instantly just disappeared.  The caller was trained in the military in photo analysis, and perhaps other specialties.  He was very precise in his description, using very unambiguous terms, and the proper use of angles, rather than distances. Also, he served in the UN forces in 1979 with the Peace Keeping Mission, arising out of the Camp David Accords.

The caller was riding his motorcycle with his friend, when they realized that the father of the friend, who had been riding behind them, was no longer in sight. The young men turned around, drove back down the road, where they found the father stopped in a turnout.  The father told them to turn off their engines and lights, and that there was something in the valley they should look at. The three of them witnessed six huge lights hovering in the night sky, and a seventh identical object sitting on the ground, which lit up the valley they were in for &quot;10 to 15 miles around.&quot;  The objects in the sky were oriented in a straight row.Suddenly, the object on the ground began to rise into the air, at which time the object positioned on the far right of the formation in the sky moved down and under its neighboring object.The light that had been on the ground disappeared from sight, and then the objects in the sky disappeared in sequence.  When they arrived at their destination, the father informed the others that he had seen another object &quot;on the other side of the mountain.&quot;

19970129	19970130	 East Greenwich, RI	 disk	5  minutes	SUMMARY:  I witnessed a UFO which may be of the Lazar&quot;Sport Model&quot; variety when I was leaving work to drive home.The UFO was circular in shape, with three distinct propulsion units on the bottom,and several red rectangular lights around the perimeter.  I witnessed this UFO when I was leaving work to drive home.  It was travelling in straight lines, forming a triangular pattern, approximate airspeed was about 150 MPH as far as I could tell.  I had the impression that it was of the type described by Bob Lazar, UUP/element 115propulsion. After approximately 5 minutes,the UFO sped away to the north.  I believe that I was in some kind of mental contact with the occupants of the craft at the time,as the triangular course seemed to circle directly around me also. I am currentlyworking on some sketches of the craft, bu tI thought it important to report the event as soon as possible.  I will email the sketches in JPEG format as soon as they are complete.Perhaps they were interested in this location because it is in proximity to several of our National Guard military installations.

I love towatch the weather. Especially adverse weather.The ball was at least 300ft high if it waswhere I believe it was. It was acompanied byno sound of thunder.Sorry if this sounds like it is not important to me, because it is very important to me.I have been waiting for any kind of sighting.This is my first actual sighting of something and I would apreciate any kind of response.I was sitting with my friend on the computer while on AOL. We were just talking to a friend and watching the snow fall whensuddenly there was a blue light outside. Itwas quite bright from where we were. And itseemed to be coming from some distance away.the start of it was like a huge blue floodlight was on in the SE corner of Reno. Thenit &apos;erupted&apos; into a huge ball of light. Overapproximately 2 seconds it grew into anapproximate 200-300 feet in diameter. At thatpoint it just seemed to explode into thesky. There was no visible body or mass. Andno sound. The thunder around here can be heardquite well due to Reno&apos;s Geological features.It is a valley surrounded by very largemountains. Making the sound travel factorvery high. Regardless, I have never seenany kind of light or fire work or lighteningstrike even remotely close to this.Thank You For Your Time,Brannon G. Blaylock

The object has &quot;massive flood lights&quot; on it, which &quot;pointed down.&quot;  The object passed within &quot;1-2 football fields&quot; of their position, although at one point, the caller reported that it &quot;went across (them).&quot;  The husband could see a peculiar &quot;shadow&quot; around (?) the object. He reported that he had never seen a UFO before, although quickly qualified it to say that he thought he had seen one 10-11 years prior. He added that his daughter, who had witnessed the entire episode, talked about UFO&apos;s and flying saucers all the way back to their home on the northwest side of Gainesville.

19930701	19961219	 Lynnwood/Alderwood Manor, WA	 light	several minutes	SUMMARY:  A bright red light hovers in the sky and then disappears.One night in July 1993, while lying in bed, I spotted through my mini-blinds a jewel-toned, red light hovering in the air where normally there would be none. I peeked through my blinds and saw a red light through the trees.  I went to my deck where I could see unobstructed and the red light was about 100 yards high.  It was a light that looked like a ruby with light coming through it.  It moved 2-3 degrees left and then right and then it disappeared.

19951224	19960226	 Christiansburg, VA	 triangle	1-2 min.	Man called to report that he, together with three other observers, had been witness to a an occurrence involving four aircraft, three of which appeared to be conventional-type military aircraft, and the fourth appeared to be an unusual, triangular-shaped object with non-conventional lighting. The observers first noticed two aircraft, which appeared to be flying a parallel course directly south, in tandem formation, at the same altitude, and separated by only 1/2 to 1 mile.  The apparent close proximity of the two aircraft is what first drew the observers&apos; attention and caused them to conclude that they were military aircraft, as opposed to commercial or private aircraft.  The individual who called and who submitted the written report stated that he and the other observers are familiar with the general flight characteristics of aircraft flying out of Roanoke, VA, airport, and they invariably maintain greater separation than what they observed for these two aircraft that had drawn their attention. Suddenly, the observers became aware of a third &quot;aircraft,&quot; which was directly ahead of the first two aircraft.  The observers immediately developed the impression that the third &quot;aircraft&quot; was being pursued by the first two they had witnessed.  The third object was less well illuminated that the first two, and its lighting pattern consisted of three red, somewhat &quot;subdued&quot; lights, arranged in a triangular pattern. Its size was approximately that of the other two aircraft. Approximately 30-60 seconds after the observers had spotted the first two conventional aircraft, they suddenly noticed that a third aircraft was flying from the northwest directly toward the triangular aircraft, apparently on a &quot;collision&quot; course with it, closing from the starboard side of the triangular-shaped aircraft, and flying at a somewhat higher speed that the triangular ship exhibited. Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.  The third conventional aircraft fell behind the triangle, and began to fly parallel to the other conventional aircraft. The incident was reported to the FAA in Roanoke, VA, and to Andrews AFB.

19960609	19960611	 Banning, CA	 light	35 min.	A young woman was driving eastbound on Highway I-10 near Banning and Idlewild, CA.  It was dark when she left home at 0400 hours, on 09JN96, and she had noted the moon in the eastern sky, so she knew what that celestial body looked like. At 0500 hrs., she noticed a &quot;slice of light&quot; above a nearby mountain top.  It was bright, &quot;like a star.&quot;  She continued to watch the object for an estimated 35 minutes (approx. 40 miles), and the object appeared to stay in the same location. She noted that whe was about the only vehicle on the highway, except for a truck that was behind her, &quot;approximately 2 miles.&quot;Then, the left side of the bright object blinked twice (she thought), and the whole object turned black, or perhaps gray.  However, the object remained stationary, and the &quot;core part&quot; of it appeared to the observer to be round.  She also added that the object looked like a &quot;sideways Vee.&quot;  (?) The object remained stationary during this part of her sighting.  However, when the object was abreast of her, off to the left (?) side, it suddenly disintegrated and disappeared, like an &quot;etch-a-sketch.&quot;  She believes she witnessed a UFO as a teenager.
19960620	19960620	 Oakley, CA			Anonymous female calls to report sighting of peculiar object on previous evening. She was driving down highway and witnessed a large, flashing light above her.  At first, she thought it was a large jet, but it was &quot;almost floating.&quot;  The pack of the lights was irregular, quick, and sporadic.  They were principally red and white sporadic, flashing lights. She pulled off the road and witnessed the object change course and pass overhead.  When she arrived home, where she has an open bakc yard, she could see it in the distance.  It was almost ciruclar in shape, but it was flat in front.  It was almost as if the front of the object was cut off. She was frightened by the object, she felt fatigued when she got home, and she went straight to bed.
19961003	19961209	 Derby, CT	 light	30 - 40 minutes	SUMMARY:  Two large lights were seen high in the sky. The objects swung around, changing position with one another, then the top object vanished.  The other remained visible as we traveled forabout 20 miles.I was driving, and my friend ((name delted)) was a passenger.  We were on Route 8, on our way from Naugatuck, CT to Norwalk, CT.  About 1/3 of the way to Norwalk, in Derby, I spotted two large, bright lights in the sky, and pointed them out to ((name deleted)).  The lights were larger than a visible planet would appear; the closest description I can give as to size was that they were similar in size to street lights viewed from a car, only they were clearly very high in the sky, so the actual size of the objects had to be enormous.  We watched the objects, which were hovering in place, the one on the left a little higher than the one on the right.  Suddenly, the objects moved, rotating around one another (top to bottom) to switch places with one another.  Then, the one which had moved to the top winked out, just vanished.  There was a faint trail leading upward where that one had been, but it disappeared quickly.  I drove another few exits to Shelton, CT, where we got off of the highway onto Bridgeport Avenue.  We stopped at a car dealership which had a clear view of that part of the sky (I&apos;d say, south, maybe south east part of the sky--I&apos;d have to look at a map to be more specific--we were driving generally south at the time).   We got out of the Jeep and stood in the lot, watching the remaining light.  It kept its position.  After a few minutes, we got back into the Jeep, and I continued to drive to Norwalk.  We watched the light all the way to Norwalk; it remained the in the same part of the sky the entire way (probably for a total of 20 miles or so), so it had to be pretty high up.  When I dropped ((name deleted)) off at her home, I had one more look at the object by a running track near her house, then I headed home (driving north, so I could no longer see it in front of me).  I couldn&apos;t see the part of the sky where it was when I got home, so I just went inside. The lights were pale yellow or white-ish in color.  I thought they seemed round, but ((name deleted)) said at the time (and has maintained) that they seemed triangular to her.  They were definitely not airplanes (we saw plenty of planes in the sky that night--no comparison).  They also didn&apos;t behave like planes.I&apos;m 29 years old, female, married, a webmaster/graphic designer by profession.  I&apos;ve never seen any unusual phenomena in the sky before, and have always been skeptical about the whole UFO thing.  While these lights may not be alien in nature, I certainly can&apos;t explain them (if you figure out what they were, please let me know!)  I don&apos;t know ((name deleted)) age (mid to late 40s perhaps).   She is currently attending college full time to get her masters in painting, and I believe a certificate to teach (or something of that nature).  If I can give you any further specifics, please contact me.

19961218	19961218	 Salinas, CA		3 min.	The caller got out of bed to watch TV.  He was sitting next to a window with venetian blinds, which were open, so he could see up. He saw 3 green lights in a triangular formation &quot;cruising&quot; overhead.  They were not moving very fast, and they clearly were not any kind of conventional aircraft. The observer went outside to get a better look at the lights, which were solid--not blinking--but they were gone.  However, he noted a very prominent light &quot;at the head of Orion.&quot;  the light was red, yellowish, and gold, and it had the shape of an arrowhead, but the back side of the object was &quot;recessed a bit.&quot;Then a second object joined the first!!  It looked like a small, white, flashing light.  Then both objects moved out over the Pacific Ocean.  At this point, the larger craft split into two separate objects, the two parts recombined, and then the formation disappeared over the horizon.

19790815	19961217	 Beach Haven Terrace (Long Beach Island), NJ	 fireball	4-5 seconds	SUMMARY:  Fireball flying parellel with the horizen,then exacuting a 90 deg. turn over the horizen.The setting; approx. 10:10pm on Long Beach Isl.New Jersey.  The weather was clear and the windwas minimal.  This Isl. is about 90 miles so.of N.Y. City, there at least two military basesrelatively close by.  There was 5 0r 6 of us sittingclose to the waterline at Beach Haven Terrace beach.  As this is a summer recreation areaand I was 19 years old at the time we were partying at the time of the sighting.  At thetime of the viewing I was not out of control perhaps slightly high but nowhere near to the point of halucinating (sorry about the spelling). I was facing the Ocean and I was just taking in the veiw, for example I noticed some boats and ships out for an evening cruise and that the Moon illuminated the sky enoughto see the eastern horizen very clearly. At thispoint out of my left eye I saw a very bright light parallel with the horizen, using my thumb at arms length I would estimate it at 1 or 2 degrees above the clearly seen horizen. Afterabout a second or two I shouted out to the othersto look over there. All but one of us saw it(the guy with his back to the sea was&apos;nt quickenough). by the time everyone looked it startedto do a 90 degree turn over the horizen and it did not appear to slow down, the fireball&apos;slight faded over the horizen within a secondor two.  And thinking back on the moment (later on that night whenI was tring to get to sleep) I believe I saw the siloutte of a cigar shape craft in frontos the fireball. This I can not be absolutly sure since my eyes did not have enough time to focus in on any details of what ever it was.I am also aware of the fact that it seemed to be reacting to my excitementfor the 90 deg. turn accured directly striaghtout from our position, a coincidence maybe, butI wonder.  I hope you can coralate this report with someoneelse who witnessed this event,I sure some of thefolkes on board some of those ships got an evenbetter look at it since they were much closer.I&apos;m just guessing but I believe it traveled atleast 2 or so in the time it was flying strightThe fireball did not get much bigger whenit was straight out from our position on the beachwhich is as close to sea level as one can get.With the help of a math oriented person you could get a rough ideaof how far it traveled and approx. speed.By the way I realize that CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND had just come out in 77 and I really did want to see a UFO but at that timein my life I just had a passing interest inthe subject.  Hope this report helps.David Mitchell
19970112	19970210	 Billings, MT	 light	5 minutes or less	SUMMARY:  Two bright red lights moving in perfect formation flew over Billings on the evening of Jan.12, 1997.  They were&nbsp;flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound.On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend&apos;s house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn&apos;t start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.  If there are any questions please email me.  I can positively state this was not any conventioal airplane.

His attention was suddenly drawn to a &quot;bright light&quot; against the dark storm clouds to the north, and was approximately 500-1,000 feet above the ground, he thought. It seemed to be just hovering, and it didn&apos;t seem to be getting closer or farther. Suddenly, it rose up and drifted to one side, then stopped abruptly.  It turned, and it appeared to be elongate, almost blimp shaped.  He got his binoculars from his car, and looked at with them.  When he bent down to let his daughter use the binoculars, when he looked back up at it, it was gone. He ran out in the large field behind his house to see if he could spot it again, but it was gone.
19961205	19961205	 Brooksville, FL			The caller was standing outside, waiting for the space shuttle to arrive.  Suddenly, he notices two white lights flying very fast, which were positioned beside one another.  The sky was very clear, and the stars were very prominent in the sky when he saw the two objects. They were neither a missile, nor an aircraft, the observer emphasized.  They were traveling too fast for that (?), he averred, and they were very high, he thought.  He called the local sheriff&apos;s office, where he was given the Center&apos;s telephone number.The caller mentioned that he was college educated, and that he had never seen anything like this in his life.

The object &quot;came down into&quot; Holder Creek, at which time the caller noticed two jets--probably airliners--pass by in the nearby sky.  After the jets had passed by, the object then came back up.  It made the &quot;same pattern,&quot; and it was getting closer, she thought, and it was &quot;running low.&quot; At this point in the caller&apos;s story, she is suddenly running away from a bright light, which was &quot;coming at her from behind.&quot;   She said it was &quot;long, oval, and shaped pretty flat.&quot;  It was pretty close by, and it had several &quot;minimal white lights.&quot;  It was very dull, and cream colored. The caller had never seen a UFO before this experience.

It is one of my most rememberable thoughts of that time in my life.
19960617	19960617	 San Diego, CA	 light	20 min.	Caller was sitting outside while speaking on the telephone.  He was observing aircraft land at Lindbergh Field.  Suddenly, he noticed a tiny bright object moving to the east, crossing the approach pattern to the airport.  The object seemed suddenly to turn, and then appeared to begin gaining altitude.  At this point, its velocity made it appear as though the object was just &quot;cruising, like a normal aircraft.&quot; The observer, at first, thought the object was a balloon.  When it started to &quot;rise,&quot; he though that it had simply been caught in an updraft.  The object had a flashing appearance, and it appeared to have a ring around its equator. Suddenly the intensity of the glow that emanated from the object got very bright, and it ceased moving.  It remained in the same spot for 15-20 minutes. The observer got his neighbor, and obtained his glasses.  Then, after 15-20 minutes, during which time the object was motionless, a military aircraft approached from the north, flying south, headed in the direction of the object, and which suddenly dove very fast, &quot;like a kamikaze.&quot; The object suddenly disappeared from sight, not to be seen againThe observer called KOGO Radio in San Diego.

19951025	19970101	 Sandals Royal Jamaican Resort, Montego Bay (Jamaica),	 rectangle	3 seconds	SUMMARY:  honeymooners see huge black object in sky illuminated by moon off the shore of Montego Bay. It glides by quickly and silently, then disappearsMy husband and I had just finished dinner at the restaurant at our Honeymoon Resort when we decided to walk along the beach back to our rooms. Most of the resort guests were at a barbeque on the nearby (50 yards away) island called Kokomo, so the resort was fairly quiet and we were alone, except for maybe an employee now and then. We decided to stop and enjoy the stars. We were both silently enjoying the view when I noticed a huge black object. ( I cannot however, determine how far away it was) it cast a slight reflection on the underneath side of it, as if the moon were glowing on it. The only way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a large stingray without a tail sailing through the sky. It did not make a sound, and it lasted only seconds. I could not figure out what I had seen, I hesitated, and then asked my husband if he had seen it too. He said yes, and said he was glad I had seen it because he though it was his imagination. We tried to explain it to ourselve!s, but the only thing we could come up with was that maybe it was a large black bird gliding over the water. But the only birds we had ever seen near the bay were totally white. The bird would have also had to have been within 5 feet in front of us to appear so large. We would have seen the bird clearly because the resort had small lamps that lit the nearby walkways, and we were able to view a gazebo that stretched out in front of us about 25 feet away. We tried unsuccessfully to see the object again, and finally gave up after about 15 minutes. I don&apos;t really recall the exact moment of the sighting, because it happened over a year ago, but we did immediately tell our family about in when we returned home. My husband and I are both college educated, 25 years old, and are successfully employed in the Washington, DC metro area. Please use this information as you wish. If it means anything to you, or is similar to anything ever reported, then please feel free to let us know, other!wise we just wanted to tell our story and remain anonymous. Thank you.

19970118	19970130	 Las Vegas (SE of), NV	 sphere	5-10 sec	SUMMARY:  Luminous sphere (white) travelling due west at a very high velocity (it slowed down and then accelerated). It moved along a ridge of a mountain before it suddenly disappeared.A friend and I were driving from Phoenix to Las Vegas (I believe that the number of the highway is 93). We passed through Kingman, Az and a little later, around 10 pm, I noticed a light moving to our right. I brought it to my friends attention and we watched a single object come out of the east, travelling west over the ridge of a small mountain. There was only one object. It was small and luminous, but not very bright. It looked about three times the size of a regular star. I would have considered it to be a conventional aircraft, had it not been for the way it moved. It was extremely fast. It came in, slowed down somewhat, and then accelerated. Also, its path was a little erratic, not very smooth. After about only five seconds I lost sight of it. It could have disappeared behind the ridge, but to me it looked like it simply vanished. My friend and I are both senior psychology students at Arizona State University. My friend is extremely skeptic with regard to UFOs, but we both agree that it wasn&apos;t an airplane, a helicopter, or a satelite.

She went into the bathroom to tend to her arm, and the husband lay on the bed, with his feet facing to the west as he looked out the double French doors to the west. Suddenly, he noticed a large, orange, luminous object, seemingly in the distance, that appeared to be flying directly toward his location.  At first, he thought it might be a reflection of the security keypad on the wall by his bed, but he quickly realized that its color is green, not the shade orange or red he was observing. The husband got out of bed and continued to observe to object by looking through the center pane of the door.  The object was brilliantly bright, and it looked like a fireball.  Suddenly, the object made a 90 degree turn to the south, at which time its &quot;firey&quot; tail could be seen by both him and his wife.  The wife commented that it was &quot;like a comet.&quot;  The tail&apos;s color was golden orange, and it was &quot;bigger on top&quot; than it was on the bottom.  Also, material was being ejected from the object, and it appeared to be burning.  The object just seemed to dissapate in the southern sky. The caller added that he does not see how anyone in the San Joaquin Valley could have missed it.Also, the caller added that when he was a graduate student in Long Beach, CA, in 1974, he saw a formation of four triangular shaped objects, imbedded in a cloud of green tinted light, pass overhead of his penthouse apartment and head north.

19960901	19970205	 Fort Collins, CO	 disk	1 min.	SUMMARY:  Sighting of crescent moon shaped object at about cloud high, traveling from NNW to SSE in direction of Denver CO, at 9:30 PM. No sound. Two witnesses.Sitting in back yard with my wife, we were facing south watching the sky because I had seen something similar to this the previos year that my wife could not see. I looked over my right shoulder to the NNW. As I looked into totaly clear skys with bright stars this object appeared in my field of vision. Just as I saw it I said to my wife who had just turned her head, &quot;Do you see that&quot;, her reply was &quot;Oh my God I do&quot;. We both watched it proceed about cloud height above our heades and move very steadily to the SSE in the direction of Denver. I had my camera with and tryed to take pictured but they were only black when developed. As we watched it disappeared before it was at a distance that we thought it should have. It just faded out. The object appeared to be illuminated by ground lights from the city, and looked like the front edge, and bottom of a disk. It had the shape of a cresent moon, with a slight point in the center and back. There was no sound. Judging by the hight !it seemed to be around 100ft-150ft across.About a year before this we had been sitting in the same place in the yard and I saw the same thing going in the opposite direction (SSE to NNW)  that was the same shape, size, and hight, except that it had four rectangular blocks of light on the leading edge, and my wife could not see it even though she was looking exactly where I pointed. If there were any other sighting in the area around the same time, I&apos;m interested.

19960225	19960225	 Doylestown, PA		3 min.	A young man, audibly agitated and upset, called to report his experience, which had occured approximately 90 minutes earlier.  He was driving his van east on Route 313 (?) in Bedminster Township, approximately 3 miles north of Doylestown, PA, when he observed three very bright objects, which he interpreted to be &quot;shooting stars.&quot;Approximately 2-3 minutes later, as he was descending a steep grade in the road, his lights and engine began to falter, then they quit altogether very abruptly.  Also, the van stopped very suddenly, although he noted that he was not thrown forward when it stopped, which he thought was unusual.  Then he felt &quot;something move through the truck,&quot; and when he attempted to turn the ignition key to restart the van&apos;s engine, he could not move, either his hand, or any other part of his body.  It was at this point that he felt that something was in the van with him, which was &quot;reading his thoughts.&quot;  He later added that it felt that there was something &quot;right inside his brain.&quot;  This part of the experience lasted, he thought, &quot;only a second.&quot;Suddenly, he noted that the engine in his van was running again, even though he had not tried to restart the engine.  It just started of its own accord. He added that it had been very windy that night, but when the object was above him, there was a sudden &quot;whoosh&quot; of air, and it was gone. He saw no bright lights, nothing discrete or palpable.  He woke his girlfriend when he got home, and wrote down the whole incident.I called Paul G. Johnson, SD for MUFON in Pennsylvania.  He directed me to Dr. David M. Jacobs, and to Tom Carey, State Section Director.((NUFORC Note:  This is a dramatic case, and the witness seemed quite sober-minded, to us. PD))

19961031	19961127	 Boerne, TX		30 sec.	An on-duty security officer at a major hospital went outdoors to patrol the parking lot from 0200 to 0300 hrs..  At about 0215 hrs., he estimates, he saw a peculiar blue light, which he estimated to be about 100 yards from his location.  It was visible between two trees. He jumped out of his truck, ran into the parking lot, and he got a better look at the object.  It was a blue light, moving very slowly, approximately 100 feet above the ground.  It was moving from his left to right. The moon was out at the time.  The object moved in front of a cloud, so it was silhouetted against the light colored cloud, at which point the observer could see its shape.  It was distinctly square in shape.  The observer described the object as looking like a &quot;coffee table (round?) with a smaller rectangular box on top--like a shirt box.&quot;  Box was about 1/3 the size (diameter?) of the round part.  The object then moved away from him, the observer estimating that it may have moved approximately 1/4 mile in one second.  It then hovered for a short period of time, then it streaked toward the observer, coming within 100 feet of his position, this time, and still about 100 feet in the air.  The object then moved to the left, then the right, moving &quot;like a bug in the wind--erratically.&quot;  The object flew over the tope of the hospital and disappeared from the observer&apos;s sight.

She was awakened by a buzzing, which at first she thought was her refrigerator upstairs which had &quot;gone on the blink.&quot; She went upstairs to check it, and discovered that the buzzing was not coming from her refrigerator, so she looked outside to the northwest.  Suddenly, she noticed a large, hovering object that was blindingly bright, generally circular, and flat on top.  It was situated &quot;between some trees.&quot;  The object was very low to the ground, and it was much larger than a full moon.The caller was frightened by what she saw, although she went back to bed and went to sleep.  She volunteered that she did not sleep well that night.  She was not a believer in UFO&apos;s before this incident.

19960528	19960603	 Mindon, UT	 cylinder	1-2 sec.	Young woman watching television while sitting on beanbag in bedroom observed a very bright green cylinder go streaking across the sky and disappear behind Hogsback Mountain.  It seemed to be luminous green from within, and it lit up the whole area.  At first, she thought it might have landed, but she could not be sure--it just went behind the mountain. Itappeared that &quot;stuff was coming out the back.&quot;  It illuminated the entire area with green light. the sighting was during the David Letterman program.  A taxi driver had just left the stage, and Bill Cosby was about to come on. She called the police, who reported that two pilots in the area had reported a green flash.  Also, two people in Brigham City had reported apparently the same event.  She called the Utah State University the next day, but they said they didn&apos;t have anything flying that night. Her daughter&apos;s birthday was the next day.  She just saw a brief flash.  It scared her, and she called her friend.  No sound was evident, but she was inside her house with the television on.Salt Lake City FAA (Cedar City Facility--(800) 992-7433) at first said they didn&apos;t have our telephone hotline number, but then they gave her our number. I got her permission to give her name to Zack Van Eyck.  I recommended that she send a letter to the Editor of her local paper.I asked her for a report, map, and an illustration.  She said she alread had an illustration done.
19961218	19961218	 Eugene, OR	 light	1 hour	SUMMARY:  Father and son saw a light at high altitude perform zig-zags, abrupt starts and stops, and 90 degree turns.I am 18. I was going to bed at 0430 when I looked out the window at the sky. I saw what I tought to be a satellite or the space shutle slowly and steadily track across the sky from the south-east twards the north-west. I watched this object for a minute and than it stoped. I thought it was strage, but I sthat it might be a satellite that had moved itself into a geosynchronous orbit or possibly the space shutle that had done the same. Than it started to move strangely. It started to do little zig-zag patterns and move very slowly and rock back and forth. It also did a couple of 90 degree turns. I watched it for about 10 minutes, than I went and woke up my dad. He came and we watched it zig-zag and turn and start and stop and do spirals. The spirals seemed strange, to me, because it would start out with a big, slow circle and than the circle would began to tighten and it would speed up untill it had come to rest where it started. I think I can best desc!ribe the spirals as looking like a planet falling into the sun. All this time the sum of its movemets were bringing it twards the west (twards us). My window faces East. At one point I thought I saw a small light seperate from it and head South-West. It was so faint that I wouldent have thought anything of it except that my dad asked me if I saw it. My dad went back to bed about 0515 and by 0530 it was out of sight over my roof. I thought about going outside to watch it some more, but I thought it was too cold and I had watched it for an hour anyway, though I hope I didn&apos;t miss any big exit.;)

It had windows, and each window had a different color in it!  It was generally oblong in shape, and it looked to be &quot;smaller than her Cadillac.&quot;  There were sections on the object that she could not see because of the lighting, perhaps its location, as well as its brilliance.  It gave off no sound.  Two of the callers friends had seen it, also.  Suddenly, the object zoomed off.At least two other people, friends of the caller, saw it, as well.

19970108	19970127	 Brooklyn, CT	 disk	2 seconds	SUMMARY:  Flat, round object heading rapidly SE horizontally.I was on my way home from work on roads I&apos;ve travelled at this time of day for the past 35 years. Suddenly this object appeared coming from behind me above tree level heading in a SE direction relatively horizontal. It was very clear and bright (a whitish sort of metallic light). There was no haze or bluriness at all. The object was circular with very clear edges. It appeared to have either a raised middle section or a lighted area around the center. It was travelling at tremendous speed and was out of sight in just a couple of seconds. At first I thought it was a reflection but there are no street lights in the area and it was going too fast. It definitely was not an airplane nor a shooting star. It was too sharp and clear for a shooting star and too round for an airplane. Besides, it was going too fast for a plane, even a jet. I have worked at the University of Connecticut since 1961 and have never seen anything like this on any of the roads I travel to get to and from wor!k which is 28 miles from home. I have seen another strange sighting at home in Moosup, CT 06354. I was outside one night with my dog. While she was doing her business, I was looking at the stars. Suddenly a light appeared just like a light bulb had been turned on and darted across the sky. It was quite a while ago, maybe a couple of years, so I don&apos;t remember exactly which way it was going after it &quot;lit up.&quot; I think it went from NW to SE at a rapid rate and was out of sight in just a few seconds, probably five or six.

19650715	19970128	 Nyona Lake, IN	 cigar	30 minutes	SUMMARY:  Cigar shaped object. 25,000 to 40,000 ft. high. Color silvery and at times white. Summer 1964, 0r 1965. UPI reported it was seen in 8 other states.It was a silver cigar shaped object. 25,000 to 40,000 feet up. No wings, no sound. Could stay perfectly still in the air. Also moved to right or left  horizontally, without turning. It appeared tp be able to travel at extremely high speeds.3 children and 3= adults witnessed this event. According to UPI, U.F.O. sightings were reported in eight states at the same time of the Nyona Lake sighting. Unsure of  exact date.The U.P.I. story stated that the air force said that what was seen was the planet Jupiter. Robert Risser director of thre Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation planetarium in Oklahoma City , said that watchers in Oklahoma certainly did not see the planet. &quot;that is as far from the truth as you can get. Somebody has made a mistake.&quot;
19961211	19961211	 Birmingham, AL		105 sec.	Caller was stopped at a red light on Highway 31, a major highway that goes through Alabama.  He was in the City of Estadia, AL, at the time of the sighting. He looked to the north, and suddenly noticed an object flying above the northern horizon.  It was just a bright ball of fire with the speed of a &quot;falling star.&quot;  The object just shot across the sky!  The observer&apos;s impression was that it was a large object, perhaps the size of a Boeing 747.The observer&apos;s first reaction was that it was a meteor, but it suddenly stopped, did a 180 degree turn, then shot back to the northwest, and suddenly disappeared.  His impression was that the object had covered a distance of 20 miles in perhaps a very short period of time, measured in seconds. After the object started back to the northwest, it accelerated, then slowed, and then regained speed.  However, it accelerated very fast, not like an aircraft. The observer pulled across the highway and went into a McDonald&apos;s Restaurante parking lot, where he sat for 3-4 minutes to see if the object would return.

19960315	19960315	 Evansville, IN		5 min	He and a friend were driving near Evansville, when they sighted two bright, orange lights suddenly appear in the northern sky.  Their impression was that the lights were not very far away, and perhaps at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet.  They appeared to be low. After several seconds, the objects disappeared from sight, then reappeared shortly soon after.  The second object suddenly shot off.  About 3-4 minutes later, they saw them in the northwest sky.  Initially, it was one bright, orange,  large light, which then split into approximately 5 objects.  They formed a formation for about 5-10 seconds, which then simply disappeared.
19960209	19960209	 Whidbey Island, WA		5 min.	Five adults were witness to an object to what appeared to them to be &quot;three diamonds in a row, moving in unison.&quot; in the western sky.  The object(s) had flashing lights on it (them).  They estimated the object&apos;s (apparent) length to be equal to 4-7 times the diameter of the earth&apos;s moon. Even though they could not make out the shape of the object because of its distance from them, it appeared to be proceeding from north to south at a steady pace.  It was midway (vertically) between Venus and the moon.  They were located on E. Milman Road on Whidbey Island when they observed the object(s) .
19961116	19961118	 Greenwich, CT			Caller, who had reported sighting from Greenwich, CT, on 16NO96, called the NUFORC to apprise us that the news in New York were reporting the incident involving a Pakistani and TWA airliners. He said he thought it to be the case that the TWA airliner had requested clearance to return to the airport for landing after its crew had witnessed the object that streaked by the Pakistani airliner.
19960103	19960114	 Fort Smith, AR		1 min.	Caller was taking out trash, when he observed three greenish-yellow balls of light that dipped down out of the clouds.  They hovered for approximately 1 minute, then they went back up into the clouds.He telephoned the local police, the local airport, and the local television station(s).  There had been several other observers to the phenomenon.
19961221	19961221	 Poulsbo, WA			A young male called to relay a report of what his girl friend had just witnessed the night of his call. She had been out driving on a rural road, and was on a straightaway stretch, when she saw a very brightly lighted, small &quot;flat&quot; object.  It was perhaps 100 yards in front of her car, and it was hovering over the roadway. Suddenly, the object zipped off through the woods, and she could see a small area of the woods illuminated as the object passed through the woods

19961226	19961226	 Fontana, CA		30 min.	Young woman calls to report witnessing 3x strange lights in the sky.  They were neither aircraft, nor helicopters, since some of them were in the air at the time, and they were easily distinguished from the lights she was observing.Suddnely, one of the lights extinguished, but the other two stopped and hovered.  They proceded to move very slowly.  The observers knew they were moving, since they could see them move relative to nearby trees.  They stayed in the same relative position in formation.
19960101	19960101	 Phoenix, AZ		35 min	Call # 3 - No tape - 4 Observers watch 1 to 4 lights (like dim stars) move erratically throughout sky for 35 minutes.  Then 5 boomerang ships streak across sky to the NNW towards Flagstaff.  (Also described as circles with an oval cutout).  Ships are in V formation.  Glowing silver underbelly is visible.  No sound.  Observers call airport and are referred to NUFORC.  No tape of report at callers request.  Spoke with caller and caller&apos;s uncle.  Observers were 8 miles from Phoenix airport.

19960319	19960319	 St. Petersburg, FL		20 min.	Total of five observers were looking at a bright object in the western sky, approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. I first assumed it was Venus, but the caller was adament that when an airplane flew nearby, the object shot off to the south as far as he could see, then it came back to its original position!!  Then, while we were talking, he stated that it suddenly dropped down significantly to the horizon.I could hear the other parties in the background talking about the object.  One woman, who was looking at the object with some form of magnification, stated that it looked like it had &quot;seven panels&quot; on the bottom of it.  The caller stated that it looked like it had two headlights on it, with a bar running down the middle, perhaps.  This one is confusing!!  How can Venus streak to the south, and drop down. I asked them to watch it tonight, and to look for it again tomorrow night in the same area of the sky.
19960116	19960116	 Monitor, WA		5 min.	Husband and wife called to report sighting of 6 bright orange balls of light above the Wenatchee River.At first, they witnessed an orange glow moving parallel to the Wenatchee River.  The altitude, they thought to be about 400-500 feet, and they appeared to be about 3 feet in diameter. Two of the objects were close together, with the third one lagging behind a bit.  Then, they looked to the west, and they noticed three more similar objects coming from the west, whence the first three had come.  Two of the second group were close together, with the third one standing off somewhat, as in the first case. The objects rose up to a higher altitude, and went over the ridge, or hill, to the east of their position.  They reported the sighting to the local sheriff&apos;s office.  They added that a local disc jockey with KPQ Radio had reported seeing something very similar a few days earlier, and he talked about it over the radio.

19961123	19961123	 Stockton, CA		30 min.	A woman called to report that she and her daughter, after going to a pharmacy, were driving home from Lodi to Stockton along Route 3 and other rural roads. Suddenly, her daughter saw a big round disc, with bright lights inside its rim, that appeared to be following them.  They lost it and got back in the car (!!), and went to a second pharmacy.  When they left the second pharmacy, they witnessed the object a second time, this time right beside their car.  They got a very good look at the object this time. It appeared to them to be the size of an aircraft--perhaps a 747--and it was distinctly round.  When asked, the caller said she thought it was more spherical than circular.  It had many white lights on it, perhaps a hundred or more. The occupants of other cars saw it, too.  There were possibly two other cars that had stopped, and the occupants were standing outside looking at the object.  They were stopped in an area which is totally dark, with nothing but fields around.They called the Lodi Police to inquire whether there had been other calls.  They said there had been no other calls. I gave the caller Ruben Uriarte&apos;s address.
19951101	19961227	 Lakeport (near), CA	 light	5 hours	SUMMARY:  Two brothers hunting 6 miles from the main road. Parked on a pullout near the top of the ridgetop. Saw red-green halo light moving across opposite ridgetop where no road existed.  Traversed ridge at medium speed then stopped, shot up to higher altitude, performed some unusual aerial manuevers before parking in the sky to the SE. It was soon joined by another identical light which also became stationary.  A large, flat, silent dark perfect triangular craft came down between the two lights and proceeded directly by them up the valley. It flew below the top of the ridge and was clearly visible for 30 seconds to a minute before it passed out of sight. The two lights remained where they were and were visible even after daylight.&quot;Dunn sighting&quot; two. The brothers were hunting near Highland Springs and were again sitting in their truck parked in a pullout near the ridgetop facing east, looking out over the valley between them and the opposite ridge.  It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. Suddenly a light appeared to the NE over the opposite ridge.  They both thought it was a vehicle at first but having hunted the ridge they knew there was no road there only brush.  At brushtop height and as large as a truck the light progressed along the ridge.  Viewing it with a 20power spotting scope they describe it as a redish-green pulsing light with a clear white light in the middle.they didn&apos;t know what it was but were able to follow it in the scope,(on a tripod), until it reached the end of the ridge to the SE. There it &apos;jumped&apos; back and forth in the sky for a number of minutes. They were unable to keep it in the viewfinder during these &apos;jumps&apos;.  It then became stationary in the sky.  After a while, from the SE and much further away, a second identical light appeared and flew toward the first one, joining it slightly further to the west but also stationary.  The two lights never moved again.  About 04:30 a large flat, dark and perfectly triangular craft came from between the two lights.  At first they thought it was a plane but it came directly down the canyon they were looking out over, from SE to NW, and lower than the opposite ridge.  It flew at a steady crusing speed and made no sound except for the sound of air being pushed, like a hissing breeze. There was a slight haloed gaseous effect coming from the craft that made it difficult to observe with !the scope but didn&apos;t affect the nnaked eye.  A single spotting clear light shone out ahead from the middle underside of the craft.  What appeared to be windows also were apparent.  They both felt that if they could see it, it could see them and they felt like sitting ducks!  However they were not as frightened as the first time they witnessed a sighting. The way it cruised by reminded them of tourists driving through town.  They estimated it at approximately 25 yards wide.  As it passed two red lights, like taillights shone out from the back of the craft.  They waited for the noise but none came.  They stayed at the spot until dawn, viewing the two original bright lights.  These lights remained in exactly the same location and were so bright they could still be observed after daylight.  They finally got tired of watching and drove home.  Two interesting questions are posed by their two sightings in different wilderness locations.  Either they are simply fortunate to have been !in the direct paths, away from civilization, of these vehicles and their sightings are mere coincidences, or the crafts flew by them purposely.  In both cass they were entirely visible to any vehicle at a higher altitude from great distances away.  Also it seems outlandishly coincidental that they just happened on the particular routes of these crafts, when miles of alternative wilderness areas exist. It may also indicate a similar flight pattern of wilderness routing though it seems odd that if this routing exists to decrease sightings, no attempt was made to hide themselves from these two entirely visible observers.  The Dunn&apos;s are totally reputable men, from midland farm families, as down to earth as you can get!  They never even considered the possibility of what they witnessed until it was before them.  they still exhibit some fear as to the identity and purpose of the crafts and have not discussed or reported the events publicly. But they are now watching continually.  D!unn sighting one contains the report of their first sighting as well as their most recent land -based phenomena sighting.  They are taking me to the sights soon. I&apos;m looking forward to it!    wolf
19790901	19961207	 Rockford/Belvedere (between), IL	 disk	5-10 MIN	SUMMARY:  Saw a very large object 1000-1500 ft in diameter having difficulty.  Saucer shaped about twice the size of a quarter held at arms length about 2 miles distant.  Rotating  windows from left to right.  Saucer was wobbling very slowly for about 5 minutes.  About 20 windows observable.  Looking at object to west.  Reported to Pecatonica state police about 1 hour later and laughed at.  Reported to J.A. Hynek; NW University next dawith drawing sent in later.  I have had my son approximate these drawings with computer graphics.  It finally stabilized and floated away to the NW toward Pecatonica.  Only  a white blinking light remained after window lights were shut off.  Light appeared to be center top.  Also, no sound and other witnesses did not seem to be too concerned that they did not what this object was.  The wife and I know!Background will mildly rolling with numerous houses and apartments visable.  Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek&apos;s secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20&apos; x 70&quot;. 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven&apos;t heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.  I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.  I guess it doesn&apos;t really matter anyway.  Sooner or later everyone will see these.

19961201	19961202	 Wrightwood Mtn., CA	 light		Young man was sitting in a parking lot near &quot;Wrightwood Mountain&quot; (?), when he suddenly noticed a bright red flare in the distance.  When the caller began to leave the parking lot, the flare suddenly grew brighter, and it began to move. He pulled off the road, at which time the red light faded again, then grew bright again, and then moved off in the direction of &quot;Wrightwood Mountain.&quot;  (?)The object looked like a circular red flare, it had no tail, it gave off no smoke, and it made no sound.He called local radio stations and newspapers to see if there had been other reports, but learned of none.
19970215	19970216	 Blairsville, PA	 light	5min	SUMMARY:  Low flying aircraft hovering above elementary schoolIt was 11:35 pm and I was driving west from Bolivar Pa to blairsville on route 22.  I noticed a flash of light in the sky out my passenger side window.  I watched closely because the sky was clear.  This light flew over my car heading south west.  I watched as the light changed direstion and began to fly west hovering about 10 feet above a local elementary school.,  I watched it until it flew directly over my head and climbeed at a 90 degree angle.  Then bam all gone.  There was no sound, and no apparent release of waste from the engine.  This is the second time I have witnessed anything like this.

19961213	19961214	 Simi Valley, CA	 egg	4 min	SUMMARY:  A silver metallic object streaked across the sky in a northeast direction. It suddenly slowed to a complete stop before going straight up and performing zig zag maneuvers. It then shot off in the NE direction.  Within 45 minutes we observed 2 fighter jets flying in tight wing formation going in the same direction as the UFO.The ufo appeared to be a slightly flattened egg shape. It was a clear cloudless day, with only con trails from the airplanes in the sky. Sunlight glinted off the top and the bottom.  The object was heading toward was the Malibu, CA area.  The area where we were observing is comprised of hills and agricultral zones.  Because of the cooler temperature, all planes in the sky were leaving con trails, however the ufo did not.  I am unable to estimate how high, or how big the object was, although it did not appear to be all that high, or all that large.  The hill directly beneath the object when it stopped had sheep grazing at the time.  The speed the object moved was amazing, as were the complicated maneuvers it performed.  Approximately 45 minutes later we observed 2 fighter jets flying in close tight wing formation and heading in the direction the ufo had taken.  One of the gentlemen with me if familar with planes and fighter jets as his father was a lifer in the Air Force, and!he spent nearly all of his growing up years on AF bases.  One other interesting point, the ufo was going in the direction of Rockadyne, a company facility that builds and tests rocket engines. That is all I can think of at the moment. I am a scheduler/ dispatcher for a technical service and support department.  My educational back ground is 2 years of college, and working in the Customer Service and Support field for 23 years.  I am interested in ufology, although I am not involved with any ufo groups.  There were 2 men beside myself who saw the ufo.  They are both in the sales field for our company, and other than the gentlemen with the AF background, I am not sure of the complete back ground of the men.

19960612	19960612	 Seattle, WA	 light	5 sec.	Young man, located on the Phinney Ridge area of Seattle, while lunloading his van, looked to the southeast and sees what at first he thinks is a &quot;shooting star.&quot;  After an instant, he realizes that it is not just a single point of light, but rather three pinpoints of light, oriented in a triangular orientation. The objects were &quot;lurching&quot; relative to one another.  They went directly over his head, so he felt that he had a very good look at them. Another person was also able to view the object(s) briefly.Prior to this sighting, he had given no credence to UFO reports.
19961205	19961206	 Seattle, WA		30 sec.	The observer was standing at the window of his high rise apartment near Pike Place Market, looking west and southwest.  Suddenly, he witnessed a strange &quot;light&quot; in the sky, which at first he thought was a beam of light coming up from West Seattle.  It looked like a &quot;flattened oval of soft red/orange light.&quot;  It made a perfect arc across the sky.  It covered 2/3 of the sky during its movement.  Then, the observer realized that it could not be a search light, for example, because it was above the clouds, and he would have seen the light passing through the clouds.  The light moved across the sky in a perfect arc, as if tethered to the ground.  It appeared to travel from east to west.The clouds at the time were high and &quot;transparent.&quot;The caller volunteered that he has a slight color anomaly in his vision, and he believes anyone with normal color perception would have found the light to be more prominent in the sky than it was to him.
19951206	19951206	 Bothell, WA		4 min.	Father and daughter were driving through downtown Bothell, when the daughter called her father&apos;s attention to a peculiar, triangular-shaped object, which appeared to be flying toward them.  Its color was &quot;a beautiful electric blue.&quot;  It appeared to flip up on its side, and did some maneuvering.  It turned and hovered.  The father estimated that the object was &quot;100 blocks&quot; away from them.

He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it&apos;s true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it&apos;s the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can&apos;t stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don&apos;t care who says they don&apos;t.  That includes our goverment.
19710215	19970105	 Everglades (on Aligator Alley), FL	 disk	2 seconds	SUMMARY:  Sighted while driving across the AlleyIt was about midnight and a UFO crossed the highway in front of me at very low altitude.  It was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter andgoing extremely fast. About one second behind it was an Air Force jet fighter.  The UFO was traveling much faster than the jet.  They were so low that had it been daylight I could have read any markings on the jet. The UFO glowed very brightly and was the color of fluorescentl ight tubes. This is all I know. Yes, I realize 26 years is a long time, but I thought itmight help verify someone else&apos;s sighting.

19960103	19970104	 Hayward (next to Hawyard Airport in; I was in airport), CA	 unknown	5-6 seconds	I was with my brother at the airport fuleing up a plane. After that we drove the turkback to the fule center. I was looking toward the northward end of the runway and saw a UFObut ny brother didn&apos;t see it because he was looking the other direction while putting the ladder in the truck. It zipped across the sky at around 400 M.P.H and was bright green, really bright and it wasn&apos;t a plane, it was crossing the landing approach pattern. It came down from around 1000 feet to about 200 feet, then speed extremely fast westward while hugging the groung,about 150 feet above the local houses and dissappeared westward toward the bay. The object, to my caclulations must have been at least 70 feet in diameter and was circular. I am a current student as well as my brother in high school. I have seen many pictures of ufo&apos;s onTV and on the Sightings UFO report video. It looked similar to a ufo that I saw on TV that just zoomed across the sky in Mexico City.There was not any noise heard and the sky was very clear that night, the first clear day in about a week after large storms.I am not sure if anybody else saw it, but there wasn&apos;t many people at the airport in the area that we were in, but some peoplewho live in the houses next to the golf course, which is at the end of the runway towards the direction that the object was seen,might have seen the UFO. It was definately not a Learjet and didn&apos;t have flashing lights.P.S I will try to find a map and draw some pictures and e-mail them to you
19960820	19961118	 Owensville, MO			The caller was returning home with her two sons (ages 8 and 14 yrs.) from a neighboring town , which is about 8 miles away from Owensville.  Suddenly, she became aware of a bright light in the night sky, which was totally cloudless. At first, she thought it was a set of headlights.  However, both her house, and the house of her neighbors, were illuminated, as if by a &quot;bright headlight from nowhere.&quot;  Suddenly, the object streaked out of sight, leaving a green trail in the sky, and going in the direction of Jefferson City, to the northwest.She said that her two sons had drawn the &quot;circle of light.&quot; She lives in a rural area.

HE DID NOT WANT HIS NAME GIVEN TO MICHAEL STRAINIC, BUT HE WAS GIVEN STRAINIC&apos;S TELEPHONE NUMBER, AND MAY CONTACT HIM AFTER HE HAS SPOKEN WITH HIS WIFE ABOUT THEIR SIGHTING.* The caller is a dairy farmer, who was out in one of his fields at 0420 hours on Friday, 27SE96, preparing to begin milking his herd of cows.  He suddenly witnessed a bizarre, cigar-shaped hovering above his field approximately 100 to 200 yards away.  It was cigar-shaped, and had a bright, flashing red light on it. He attempted to ignore the object, until it began to approach him, at which time, he went to get his wife.  She was witness to it briefly, after which time, the object just suddenly disappeared in a split second!When asked whether the dairy cattle had seemed to respond to the object, or take note of it in any way, he said he did not think so, or at least did not notice any such response from them. (Davenport told him about the sighting seen from Bothell during the lunar eclipse on 26SE96.  I forgot to tell him about sighting in Florida on same night as his sighting.)

I ran downstairs...turned off my front porch lights, it dimmed its lights and floated away.The object was a round circle of lights. That&apos;s actually all it was...  it did communicate w/ me but after the second time I tried to, it floated away.
19960209	19960209	 Eureka, CA		4 min.	She called at 2307 hrs. on 09FE96 and left a message.  I called back at 1457 on 11FE96. The caller noticed a friend/neighbor standing in the street looking up.  She looked up and witnessed four lights very close together, with three more behind them, then three more still behind the first two groups.  The formation stretched across approximately one third the distance from horizon to horizon!!  They appeared to stop, start moving again, then speed up again in erratic fashions.  He friend noted that the flashing lights were &quot;wavering.&quot;  It appeared to both the observers that there were three lights on each &quot;vehicle,&quot; one quite bright, and two &quot;weaker&quot; ones. The formation passed directly above their heads, at which point three &quot;objects&quot; formed a triangle, and &quot;three of them in back lagged off.&quot;  No sound was detectable.After the objects had disappeared from sight, the observers heard an aircraft sound coming from behind them.  It turned out to be a commercial jet aircraft, which appeared to be moving very slowly, relative to the (angular) velocity of the peculiar objects they had just witnessed.She received our telephone number from the Eureka Police.
19970124	19970129	 Alta, UT	 other	3 hours plus	SUMMARY:  A &quot;moving star&quot; similar to a satellite stopped, hovered, and darted around for over 3 hours.  A telescope revealed a round shape.I observed what I took to be a satellite, until it shifted direction, and then stopped.  It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars in the sky, and not an unusual color.  It would hover for awhile, then move, sometimes appearing to spin in circles.  I first looked at my watch at 19:11, after having watched the object for perhaps 10 minutes.The object hovered in basically the same part of the sky for over three hours, at times appearing to drift, and then bring itself back to where it was before.  It often just hovered perfectly still, and looked like a star. It was roughly overhead of Alta, very high, a little  to the northeast.  Witnesses who saw it move included a member of the Alta Fire Department, a dispatcher for the Alta Marshall&apos;s office,And two members of the astronomical society at the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake.  They happened to have a nice 3inch wide telescope, and were photographing the moon.  With a higher powered eyepiece, the telescope showed the object to be pefectly round, with a darker round circle in the center.  I think the telescope was about 12000x, if I recall correctly.  The object was absolutely still in the telescope.I think the image in the telescope was consistent with looking up at the underside of a perfectly round flying saucer.  No lights were apparent on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting light from the sun which gave it the appearance of a star to the naked eye. Conceivably, this was some type of satellite being put into a fixed orbit, except for the erratic motion.  With my arm outstretched, it moved the length of my thumb, at the most.  I would like more information on types of satellites.  Personnel at the Hansen Planetarium weren&apos;t aware of any satellites that can behave like that.  I am a former Assistant Chief of the Alta Fire Department.

19920615	19961207	 Area 51, NV	 oval	12 hrs.	SUMMARY:  4 adults video tape object over area 51 in Nevada. Video shown on 2 different episodes of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.In 1992, 4 of us were able to capture on video some of the maneuvers of the &quot;Area 51&quot; object.  It shows the craft hovering, then moving down the ridge line until it disappears.  Also on video, the morning sequence which showed the craft pulsate and become brighter.  This is the segment used on Unsolved Mysteries.  Once it became totally dark it was nearly impossible to capture all of the maneuvers on video.  This thing could go from horizon to horizon in just seconds.  It would fly just like a meteor, stop on a dime, then go in a completely different direction.  We all saw the craft become brighter,almost as if it were gaining energy, then shoot across the sky.  After doing several maneuvers, the light would become dim, then go out.  The other 3 said,&quot;it just disappeared&quot;, but I was looking thru binoculars and saw what appeared to be an egg shape craft with the slightest pearlescent green glow. I watchedit go out of range.  The craft would be gone for approx. 45 minutes, then at the exact same time, all 4 of us heared a high pitch frequency &quot;inside&quot; our heads.  Then instantly, the object would appear.  I saw thru the binos what appeared to be some sort of docking with a larger ship.  There were several smaller ships throughout the evening which appeared to me as if they were helicopters observing from a distance. I am a private pilot and a former Marine.  I&apos;ve spent alot of time around planes and helo&apos;s.  This main craft was definitely not one of those.  Finally, what seemed to bother all of us the most was toward dawn, the craft came to a stop, and almost appeared to mimic a star.  It stayed in rotation with the rest of the stars &apos;till dawn.

He turned on his porch light, thinking someone was coming up his driveway, and went out onto his front porch.  He heard a strange, somewhat loud noise coming from the sky, and when he looked up, he saw three different-colored lights overhead in a triangular pattern.  The sound was like a &quot;roaring engine sound.&quot;  The object did not look like any kind of aircraft that he is familiar with. Moreover, the one large craft was surrounded by several smaller objects that had the appearance of flashing red lights.  They stood off from the larger object in the center of the formation.  He estimated their distances from the central object to be 1,000 to 2,000 feet, but he said that was only an estimate. His impression was that only the object in the center was creating the sound that had first drawn his attention.
19961117	19961119	 Arcadia, CA		3 sec.	The caller, a young man, was leaving the home of a friend in Arcadia, CA.  His friend, who is frequently joking, hit the caller on the shoulder and told him to turn around and look.  His friend grabbed him and physically turned him around. The caller, at first sceptical  about the request, turned and saw a &quot;triangle of lights&quot; in the sky.  The lights formed an isosceles triangle from the viewers&apos; vantage point, with equal distances between the lights. The &quot;point&quot; (i.e. apex) of the lights was facing west.  On the right side of the object, there simply was nothing!  Nothing was visible. The object was very lareg, twice the size of the caller&apos;s thumbnail, held at arm&apos;s length, i.e. about 4-5 times the diameter of the moon. The object moved from the viewers&apos; right to left, dipped, rose up, dipped again, rose again, then shot off to the left. The caller reported that the movement of the object were &quot;fluid.&quot;  Also, the object generated a &quot;shimmering effect&quot; around its periphery.  It looked like a &quot;camouflaged shield.&quot;
19950323	19961213	 Snoqualmie, WA	 disk	5 min	SUMMARY:  Disc shaped object with multiple colored lights hovered aprox 75 feet overhead. lights on bottom rotated to back. Lights flashing out of sync. red,blue,green,yellow,white and other colors. Rotated and slowley moved south.+On April 23 at 1:30am, a friend and I were camping in the woods in snoqualmie washington.I first noticed some lights high above us over and hill and commented that it looked like an airplane. He said it looked more like a helicopter.The clouds were fairly low and it was hard to tell so we forgot about it. A few moments later,we noticed that it was heading our direction. As it came down a hillside, we noticed that it had colors not consistant with regular aircraft.Red,blue,green,white, and yellow (there may have been other colors.) Lights were all over it flashing out of sync with each other. As it broke through the cloud cover, we saw air turbulence behind it. Not as an engine disturbing the clouds, but just as an object moving through it. It came to almost a hover aprox. 75 feet overhead and aprox 60 yards away. It made no sound and did not disturbe the trees it was very close to.Then a group of lights on the bottom rotated to the back and it rotated away from us. We noticed that we could see the color of the lights reflecting off the clouds overhead. The clouds were very low, almost a fog. It then headed south away from us.I have known my friend for 18 years, and he attends Western Washington University. I hesitated to submit this form, because everyone I have told has not believed. I hope that by telling, it will help in some small way.
19961216	19961219	 Everett, WA		2 sec.	A Boeing employee was outside the Everett Plant looking east in the night sky.  Suddenly, he noticed a green streak of light, traveling straight south, beginning to the left of Orion, and about 35% above the horizontal plane.

The first flash lasted for about 1/2 second.  The second flash occured about 2 minutes later for about 1/2 second.
19800615	19970110	 El Paso, TX	 light	5 min	SUMMARY:  Saw light travelling across skyI saw a white light at very high altitude travelling across the sky.I thought it was a satellite until it made a sharp 90 degree turn. I have seen MIR and what I saw back in 1980 looked just like it.The only thing I can&apos;t explain is the sharp 90 degree turn. It could have been an ICBM launched from nearby White Sands Missle range with a target at a Nevada test range. This was common back then and may still be.
19960128	19960129	 Chandler, AZ			A very serious-minded sounding young woman called to report that she thought something had &quot;happened&quot; to her sometime during the previous day.  She had seen &quot;aliens in her dreams,&quot; and had awakened with a sore throat, a crust around her nose, and other physical anomalies. She is a retired patrol sergeant, and she sounds to be a no-nonesense type person.  She sounded to be emotionally distraught, and was calling to seek help, most of all in the form of the name of a person, whom she could contact regarding her presumed interaction, perhaps, with something unexplained.  I gave her Bob and Cecilia Dean&apos;s telephone number in Tucson, AZ.

Then a second similar light appeared behind the first.  Suddenly, the first light disappeared.  The mother thought that it was simply the landing light on an aircraft. After several minutes, when the objects had not disappeared from their sight, the mother obtained a pair of binoculars and looked at the bright lights.  To her amazement, the objects looked shiney black, and cylindrical in shape.  They had no visible wings.  In addition, they had strobe-like lights on the bottom, and they flashed like fireworks. No clouds in the sky.  Suddenly, one object rose vertically up into the sky.

19880315	19970217	 Gallup (~10 miles west of on I-40), NM	 cylinder	1 minute	SUMMARY:  Driving west on I-40 just after dark, saw lights strobing over median of hwy. Thought it might be a helicopter, but there was no noise and the unique pattern of lights. I passed almost under it and began to slow but it had disappeared. Two hours later,on same hwy., a brown cylinder shape hovered and passed over my car. I estimated the first sight to be 40 ft up and ~40 ft wide and the second sight to be 2 and 1/2 ft long and 1 ft around.The first sighting was quite large, at least40 ft wide, with lights centered in the middle.There were three large lights, flashing not on and off but in an alternating pattern. I couldn&apos;tsay if it disappeared after I passed under it,because it was quite dark, but the lights were gone. The second sighting was around Joseph City,Arizona, on I-40.  It reminded me of a large poster tube, light brown.  It hovered at the farthest reach of my headlights directly in front of the car for about 20 seconds, came straight at the windshield to about a foot and a halfand went over the car.  I was driving for a posting job I had held at that time for about 8 months. I had left that day from Santa Fe, NM where I was visiting a friend. After the first sighting, I called my husband from the very next truckstop.

19960820	19970104	 West Manchester, OH	 disk	5-10 min.	SUMMARY:  Teen girl  saw circular UFO with orange,green,reddish-orange .A series of rectangular windows were around the middle body. One window in the center moved down.The round bottom displayed a metallic gold color. She viewed it from30ft.for 5-10 min. before it zig-zagged and shot up into the sky.I was facing north an object appeared to be hovering over a group of power lines in my backyard near a ten foot tall shed. When I saw the UFO, I felt as if I was being watched and I watched for about 5 or 10 minutes. I felt very scared  and I felt as if something drawed me outof my house. When I got outside, I saw this. (drawing will be sent later) I saw the window marked &quot;x&quot;    move open as if something was opening it. The window seemed to move  down like rolling down a car window. Teen states that at 2:15 on 8-20-1996 she was making frozen french fries and she felt drawn to go outside. She states that she never goes around back at night , but something drew  her out thereand when she looked up  she saw an object about 10 feet away  and 10-115ft. above her.&quot; well the object was really low and I saw alot of windows and appeared as if someone or something was opening it. But anyway, I nver believed in UFOs until recently. Anyway, the object was circular and the lights on the !UFO was orange, green, and reddish-orange color, but the bottom was a goldish metallic color which was a round shape. Anyway, I watched the object for a good5 or 10 minutes and then I went inside looked out the window and the object was still there but then it zig-zagged in a pattern and it was really fast and then it was gone! Then I went to bed aat about 2:45, it started about 2:15, &quot; as stated in writing by (name deleted) on August 20,1996. Note: I saw her the morning after she witnessed this and the first words out of her mouth were ,  I saw a UFO in my backyard last night. I have known her for about ten years as a neighborand I coukd tell something had happened to upset her. I sat with her and ner sister in my backyard for the day trying to calm her and asking her to write down what happened and to draw if she could the object. After a long day together she calmed down after talking about her experience. I must include that a Deputy Sheriff had been dispatc!hed to our town to look in a nearby woods after a sighting of 8 UFOsby her brother less than two weeks before. We tried to tell him what happened to her, but he didn&apos;t act interested. He just wanted to let me know he had checked out the woods at my request to the Sheriffs office and found nothing. He advised we find out who owns the woods so no one would possibly file a trespassing complaint on us for entering the woods about a week after the event became known. I checked with our County Courthouse Records and found a number of possible owners. I called each one to ask about ownership. A woman north of town told me the owner. I called the Sheriff&apos;s office back to let them know I had the owners name and then I called to get permission to reenter the woods for my husband to look around. There were some trees down in the woods, but it looked like someone had notched them out before they fell. There is an area in the woods that has a circular patch where no vegetation grows. It is barren. I had my family take pictures while in there , but when the!film was developed some prints  were lost.I still have some pictures of the teen boy standing at the end of the street and pointing to the woods he saw  light up red and where all the Ufo activity took place as described in a report filed to the Nat&apos;l UFO R.C. as having happened on Aug. 7,1996, The reports being filed with the Center for Aug. ,Sept., and Oct. 1996 by me  will include a map and drawing for each sighting as soon as I can redraw the original from my files. I am submitting a video for the Center to review for the events that happened on Oct.18,1996. I am trying to get that tape ready to mail this weekend 1-04-1997 and will include the written report to you as soon as possible using your very handy on-line report form.Thanks so much to all of you there for helping us here in Ohio with all the problems we are encountering here of late in our backyards and over our houses.Take Care all of you and a special thanks goes to Mr Gribble, not Gripple. Please excuse my wro!ng pronunciation of your name. You should have corrected me. Thans not only for the time and trouble to look at and have analyzed the video tapes  I&apos;ve been sending , but for having founded the Center in the first place. I&apos;m only sorry to have been such a troublesome part of your life in 1996, maybe I can help in the future by filing things electronically now. Thanks again to all of you so much for your help and to Mr. Davenport, I ask you to forgive me for calling in at pesky hours of the morning. I am sorry for any trouble I have caused any of you there . All I can say is that I didn&quot;t mean to.
19961222	19961223	 Reno, NV		2 sec.	Young man called to recount his sighting of a &quot;ball of blue light.&quot; He was looking at the screen of his computer, and looking out into the backyard of his home at the same time.  He saw a flash of blue light, which looked like a &quot;bubble of light.&quot;  He estimates that it was at least 1/4 mile distant, and it could have been as far as 3 miles distant, since that is how far away the edge of the valley in which his home is located is. The bubble of light seemed to the observer to have a 3-dimensional quality to it.
19961124	19961124	 Bismarck, ND	 light	60 sec.	A meteorologist for the National Weather Service called to enquire whether there had been any other reports about a burning orange light in the southern sky.  It was about 65-75 degrees above the horizontal plane, and he wondered whether it could have been the space shuttle. It appeared between broken clouds.  It was brighter and larger than a bright star, and smaller than the moon.  He said that if a person had seen it, he could not have missed it or mistaken it for a naturally occuring object. Its color looked like the orange (?) swirling flames that come out of the space shuttle when it takes off. He added that he was looking through broken clouds that were drifting, but he had the distinct impression that the object was moving.  I

19960619	19960619	 Bremerton, WA			He was a witness to the same event as another caller at about the same time. They apparently were at the same residence when they saw it.  I do not understand why both of them called. Caller reported that he had seen a &quot;green glowing orb shoot across the sky from south to north.  It had sparks flowing off of it, and it colleded in the Olympic Mountains, he thought.  There was a huge flash of light after the object (presumably) impacted.  He insisted that it was not a shooting star.

The impression of the caller was that the object had lights on it, and it was flying horizontally, parallel to the horizon, and not very high above the horizontal plane.  Object was VERY fast, vastly faster than a fighter jet would fly.  Also, object was VERY bright. The object left a distinct trail behind it, which dissipated rather quickly. Viewer felt the object almost certainly was not a meteorite.  It maintained the same shape, same brightness throughout the sighting.  At first, he thought the object was a crashing aircraft. No report on the radio stations.  He has never made a UFO report before.

19961213	19970112	 Stroudsburg (Stroud Township), PA	 light	under 2 min.	SUMMARY:  Blue light faded to red with electrical sounding hum and then repeating.The light traveled from behind our home to the side lighting the interior.I am a 40 year old mother of three,my husband is 35.My husband and I had just retired to the bedroom for the evening. As we lie there a bright blue light coming from the backyard lit the entire ceiling of our bedroom. As quickly as it came it faded only to be followed by a red light of the same intensity. Along with the lights was an electrical sounding hum.These lights repeated but now on the side of our home leaving the backyard in total darkness.There wasn&apos;t a power outage in our home because none of the digital clocks were affected. It was snowing at the time but I am unaware of any type of unusual weather occurances that could produce such an effect. Also transformers are not located anywhere in the vicinity of the lights had one blown. A neighbor having seen the same lights at the same time, from across the street experienced a power outage on that side of the street for four hours following the incident.
19960122	19960122	 Clark, MO			The mother was on the phone, when she saw a ball of light go by the front window very fast.  All told, it went around the house six times, apparently scaring everyone quite badly.  The son brought down the 12 gauge, just in case...The object made no noise.  The son said the object hovered for 5-6 seconds. He reported that it was very close to him, and he heard a beeping noise.  The mother had seen a UFO in 1983.  She saw a light zigzagging all over the place.
19930812	19970131	 Lake of the Woods (Near; closest city Ashland - 30 mi.), OR	 light	30-45 min	SUMMARY:  3 luminous objects moving extremely fast, instant directional changes, changed colorMy parents and I were observing the Perseid meteor shower in a winter recreation site.  We decided to go there because it was very dark and it was basically a large field in which we could park our pickup.  We had binoculars and a mid-size telescope with us.  As we were watching the meteor shower, we all noticed moving, starlike points which changed color from white to red.  There were 3 such objects, and they appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (at least where commercial aircraft would fly).  They were mostly directly above us or at least 3/4 up from the horizon.  We were not certain of their altitude since there were no reference points.  Through binoculars the objects appeared to be executing extremely high-speed maneuvers (looping and passing close to one another) and they could accelerate or turn VERY quickly.  The telescope was impossible to use while viewing the objects because of their speed.  There is no way these were planes, helicopters, meteors, or flyin!g insects like fireflies (there are no fireflies that change color or live west of the Rockies).  I have no clue about what they were.  I would like it if someone e-mailed me regarding this, if it&apos;s possible.
19961030	19970222	 Richmond, OH	 triangle	a few minutes	SUMMARY:  orange triangle metallic looking object sighted from windowI was sitting on couch and saw a plane? coming in the distance. No surprise since I can see many planes coming and going on the horizon from the Pittsburgh airport on clear nights. We have a good view of open skies on the hill and have watched little meteorite showers in years past. This orange light was coming west it came so close and descended heading north.  I thought it was a plane crashing to the groud a few miles from my home.  It changed angles as it turned and it appeared as a metallic bottom with a glowing orange haze.  At each point there was a bright colored light. As I ran out the front door to witness the crash I saw it quickly change direction and ascend toward the east.  It disappeared from sight at a high rate of speed.  I think it was some weird new stealth like plane or a UFO. I was alone when it happened. I&apos;m married and have a career and I don&apos;t want to be known as a nut. As I was searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed my siting I discovered y!our site.  Everyone I know was indoors at that time and I really don&apos;t want to ask my neighbors for obvious reasons. I&apos;ve done alot of soul searching on whether I should report this in any way and so here I am. If there&apos;s someone else out there I want them to know that I saw it too.  I know how I feel.  If it crashed I would have drove off to see it but since it didn&apos;t- I probably will never know what it really was that I saw. It happened all so fast.
19960618	19960618	 ,			Young man was driving on East Business Route, I-80, in Sacramento.  He noticed an object, which at first looked like a conventional aircraft, but it had four white lights.  He could not see any shape to the object, even though it was moving toward the observers, and a bit to the right. The object looked like it was in a landing mode, very low, but there is no airport in that area.  The object then rolled to one side, and suddenly they could see it.  It then descended into a nearby neighborhood.  It did not move like a conventional aircraft. They drove toward the object, but they lost sight of it because of nearby trees.  They returned to the highway, hoping to see it, but it was no longer visible. I gave the caller the telephone number for Ruben Uriarte.

19950815	19960115	 Hoh River, WA		5 sec.	While driving east on road leading up the Hoh River from Highway 101, caller observed a silver disc for about 5 seconds.  The object was an estimated 150-200 yards away from him, and approximately 200-400 feet above the tops of the trees.  The object was bright silver, and it had a dome on top.  there was a less pronounced bulge on the bottom.  It appeared to move very slowly, and the sky was bright blue.  There were 2 other people in the car at the time, but neither was able to see it, since the sighting was so brief.  They arrived at the store located further east, and the caller looked back toward the area where he had seen the object 10 minutes earlier, but he saw nothing.  Approximately 15-20 minutes following the sighting, two military jets flew very low over the area.  Caller learned of the Center&apos;s existence through the internet.He saw a ball of light fly over his head in the spring of 1984 when he lived in Elma, WA.  His sister had seen something about 2 weeks earlier in the same area. He will call his cousin in Philadelphia to confirm date of his sighting on the Hoh River.

With two antennae like objects protruding from the front.I was standing on my balcony drinking some Sprite. I first saw a bright orange light coming from a fringe of trees behind my house, and then a large tube like object,perhaps 50m long swept across over the trees, stopping for about 10 minutes and rotating in circles. It had two antennae like object protruding from one end of the tube,which moved upwards and downwards as it surveyed the area. It then disappeared, and there was another bright orange light. And I was left drinking my Sprite.

Suddenly, he saw a gray, saucer-shaped object with no lights fly from &quot;over the edge of the mountains,&quot; and fly across their heads.  the object paused for approximately 4 seconds, and then it went south in the direction of the City of Industry, where it seemed to pause again.  Then it zoomed in the direction of Walnut, CA. The object was very fast.  It could move with amazing speed.  It could stop very quickly, not like a helicopter or aircraft
19970116	19970130	 Seguin, TX	 fireball	5 seconds	SUMMARY:  San Antonio Express-News ran 3 stories on the &apos;UFO&apos; that was found in a rancher&apos;s field.From San Antonio Express-News story, 2 witnesses add their story to Seguin&apos;s &apos;X-File&apos;&quot;I was about 20 miles out of Laredo, heading for San Antonio on I-35 and I saw something like a meteor heading from southeast to northwest,&quot; Army Sgt. Roberto Cavazos said. &quot;It wasn&apos;t high, it was low. It was going very fast. It looked like a fireball with a tail. It was very, very clear. It was not a falling star or anything like that.&quot;retired rancer, Francis Zuehl said, &quot;The object was like a ball of fire with a tail. It started on my right, heading to my left, south to north... ...It wasn&apos;t high up in the sky, it was low. It wasn&apos;t going down, it was going crossways, and it was much faster than an airplane.&quot;The 3-foot round, 60-pound sphere was found half-buried on Jan. 24 by rancher Ed Longcope. It was on the cover of the San Antonio Express-News. The Air Force confiscated it but later agreed to return it. Walter Andrus Jr., who heads the MUFON in Seguin, examined the sphere shortly after it was brought to the Guadalupe County Sheriff&apos;s department. He believes it is a fuel pod from a satellite. He said he knows of only one other such object recovered, because anything re-entering the atmosphere generally burns up. He speculated this one could have survived re-entry intact if it came in at an angle.The Express-News has many photographs
19961030	19961101	 Kokomo, IN		2302	Young girl and male friend were sitting in a car facing south, when they saw two lights in the sky.  There were two solid, white lights, one on each side of the object, and a flashing red light in the middle.  They had the impression that the light was approaching their position slowly. As the object drew closer to them, it appeared to move slightly to the viewers&apos; left, then to the right. The viewers felt that the object, at its closest, was perhaps 200 yards &quot;in the air.&quot;  The young woman rolled down her car window to see if she could hear anything, and detected a high-pitched squeal.  The object was diamond shaped, and it appeared to have some kind of light in back.  Also, they could perceive visually that the object was not just &quot;beams&quot; (?) because it appeared to have a solid mass to it. The craft passed directly over their car, and it was heading to the northeast.  When they looked behind themselves approximately 5-10 seconds after it passed overhead, they could no longer see the object. The object appeared to the observers to be as big as a clenched fist at arm&apos;s length! She saw a UFO before, probably in 1990.  I gave the caller our address.  She has already drawn the object they saw.  She is on the internet. I told her about the sighting in Monterey, CA, just 9 hours earlier.

He added that there was nothing on their radar scope.
19740801	19970110	 Campbell, CA	 triangle	12 seconds	SUMMARY:  Sighting of a pair of triangular UFO&apos;s over the SF Bay Area,  August 1974In the summer of 1974,  I saw a pair of triangular objects while stargazing with binoculars.  At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it&apos;s been a long time since then,  and I haven&apos;t ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of &quot;triangular UFO&apos;s&quot;, which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of &quot;triangular&quot;UFO&apos;s.  Here&apos;s what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o&apos;clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.  It looked something like this:left (north)-                       .if this diagram doesn&apos;t-             -                .line up, select a fixed-                  -             .font (like courier).

The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I&apos;ve given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.((NUFORC Note:  As the reader probably has noted, the formation did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our website.

19960527	19961206	 Amargosa Valley, NV	 light	1hr	SUMMARY:  Friend and I witnessed &quot;flare like objects&quot;hovered more than 10 minutes per.Obj&apos;s #ing above 20. Strange person(s) watched us.On the way back from LV at approximately 20:30 hrs myself and a good friend were just driving down the road when we noticed a light in the Eastern sky.  We stopped the car and watched for a moment.  At first wethought they could be flares, then we noticedthat they were acting quite strangely.  Not intelligent type of movement, but they were staying up there for quite some time.  They were almost stationary for about 3 minutes in the skFriend and I witnessed &quot;flare like objects&quot;hovered more than 10 minutes per.Obj&apos;s #ing above 20.  Strange person(s) watched us.Then they started thier slow decent. When I say slow, I mean it took them 7 minutes to come down aproximately 100yds.That is the thing that intrigued us the most.We could see a visible trial of smoke as ifthey were flares, but they were much brighter and acted in a way that neither of us couldjust dismiss as something that was normal.They very well could be just flares and we don&apos;t know anything. But I am very good atj udging distance, adn have very good eyesight. I also feel that I am a UFO skeptic even though I am very intrigued. I don&apos;t believe that they were necessarily extraterrestrial space craft, but they were notjust a simple flare or &quot;plasma displacment&quot;.They could have been a number of different things. We have both tried to come up with explinations of the event and truely believe that that would be some what difficult toachieve. The way that they decended was thefact that forced us to come to that conclusion. It was a straight fall. But tookway too long to be a &quot;fall&quot;. It was aided bya rocket type of engine more than likely. Ifthat is so, it would more thatn likely havegone up, or been a little bit more eratic.The light was at first RED. When it startedto make it&apos;s &quot;fall&quot; it turned almost WHITE.I would very much appreciate it if someone would respond and tell me that theyknow what it is. And I hope that this willnot be taken like a &quot;stupid person reportinga light in the sky that is more than likelyjust a flare or a normal aircraft.&quot; As I havesaid; I do not think that it is alien. ButI felt that it is not something easilyachieved with any normal flare gun.NUFORC NOTE:  Location of sighting reported as &quot;just north of Amargosa Valley on State Route 95.&quot;
19960202	19960205	 Portland, OR		5 sec.	Caller witnessed a triangular-, or wedge-shaped object, with rectangular white lights on both sides--6-8 per wing, he thought--in the southwest sky.  The center portion of the wedge was all black, or dark, and was not visible.  No blinking lights on the object.  Observer estimates that the overall length of the object was 200-400, although he recognizes that it would be very difficult to estimate its length accurately.  His impression was that it was not very high, perhaps a couple hundred above ground level.  It appeared to be flying to the southwest.  He got our number from the Hillsboro, OR, airport.
19951209	19951210	 Springfield, IL		9 hrs.	The Illinois Emergency Dispatch called to report multiple sightings of peculiar flashes in night sky.  At 1830 hrs., a man witnessed a white flash. At 2245, he witnessed another similar white flash, that trailed off to red sparks.  The dispatch officer who called herself had been witness to at least one of the flashes at 2245 hrs.  She saw a blue flash behind her through her rear window.The State Troopers reported that they had seen multiple flashes, as well.

19961129	19961129	 Los Angeles, CA		25 sec.	Seven youth were playing baseball in Griffith Park in Los Angeles.  Three of them looked up and saw a blue light, which suddenly changed from one shade of blue, to another. It was &quot;polygon or a square shape.&quot;  Only three of the youth witnessed the object, even though the others had 25-30 seconds to turn and look at it, which apparently did not happen. Also, the callers said they went to get binoculars to look at the object. (Note:  That does not seem to make sense.  I would be unusual for a group of youth playing &quot;catch&quot; in a public park to have binoculars within a few seconds&apos; retrieval.)This case does not seem to be credible.

19961212	19961221	 I-10, Marker 174, NM		7 min.	A professional trucker witnessed a brightly lighted object crossing the sky.  At first, he thought it was an aircraft, but it suddenly became stationary.  At that point, he realized that the light was in fact two separate lights.  They split apart, one going to the left, and the other west straight up.  The light that had gone to the left came back around his truck and paced the truck on the left side.  Then the object pacing his truck went straight up and joined the other object, at which point they streaked off.  The object paced the caller&apos;s truck for 5-6 miles, he thought.Other trucks must have seen the objects, the caller stated, since the CB came alive, and perhaps 30-40 trucks, he estimated, were talking about the objects.  The caller had kept time, mileage, and fuel records, and all of them were normal. He commented that he had not awakened his wife during the sighting, and she was upset with him.

19960224	19960224	 Glendora, CA		2 min.	Two police officers were sitting in their police cruiser, looking west, while they talked with their shift sergeant. They noted a very bright, &quot;reddish-yellow ball with a firey tail,&quot; in the night sky to the west of their position, passing from right to left.  From the driver&apos;s seat, the object passed from the center of the windshield to the post on the left of the steering wheel.  Then, it appeared to be traveling to the east, when viewed through the side window.  At some point, the brilliance of the object subsided, and the tail disappeared from sight. However, it quickly appeared to make a second 90 degree turn to the south, at which point the tail &quot;ignited&quot; again, creating an appearance of a &quot;halo.&quot;  From this point, the observers watched the object going away from them for 5 seconds, or so, at which point it simply disappeared from sight. The officers generated an &quot;Incident Report,&quot; and it was also entered into the &quot;Daily recap.&apos;&quot; of the day&apos;s events.
19960605	19960606	 Jackson, OH		2 min.	A man called on behalf of his son and daughter, who had seen a very peculiar object on the prior night. They live approximately 10-12 miles northwest of Jackson, OH, on a county road, which is in the flight zone for Wright-Patterson AFB.  On Tuesday, 04JN96, he was dressing to go to work at about 2200 hrs., when he heard a roaring sound--like a C--47 aircraft--go overhead, apparently flying from east to west.  His daughter raced out of the house in time to witness the object, and reported that the object had green lights down one side of it, and white lights were trailing it. The next night, they experienced a somewhat similar incident.  The daughter saw the object again, and reported that it had &quot;little planes&quot; around the main object.
19951117	19951120	 Orange, VT		15 min.	Woman was driving east from Barre, VT, and saw &quot;a cluster&quot; of very bright lights apparently hovering to the east of her position eastbound on the highway out of Barre.  The closer to her property she got, the more alarmed she became that the objects were near, or above, her property.  Just at the moment she pulled off the highway to go up her driveway, she witnessed an immense flash, that illuminated the countryside with white light.  At the same instant as the flash, she saw a streak of light shoot across the sky.  It was not clear to her whether the streak was from an object ascending from ground level, or whether it had come over the horizon, from behind the hill on which her farm is located.  She immediately drove down the road, in some state of alarm, to talk to her neighbor.  The neighbor had seen the flash, and the both of them stood outside and looked at &quot;red and blue flashing&quot; lights in several points of the sky.  (Note:  Were those lights twinkling stars??)
19961201	19961221	 Columbia, MO	 light	10 min.	SUMMARY:  Little ship circling Big ship. Over eastern,Columbia MO.Dember first I was traveling eastbound on Clark LN. When I noticed a bright light, traveling slowly to the south of my location,approx.one-half mile away.The object appeared to be rotating because I saw different colored lights repeating.I.E.(red, green, blue,and orange.).This wasn&apos;t enough to really catch my eye though.It was the much smaller object that was flying around itIt was flying and manuvering around it at about 1.5 timesper second.The objects were traveling westbound,simultaniously.I wanted to report it sooner, but my girlfriend said that I,just imagined it. I didn&apos;t. I watched it for about 5 minutes,an then they just took off in a flash. And nothing was there.

19960320	19960320	 Seattle, WA		5 min.	The caller, with two male friends, was driving west on Highway 518, and they had their heads outside the passenger&apos;s window, looking at the aircraft landing at Seatac airport.  They observed three bright lights in the sky, with the approximate brilliance of stars, but they were distinct in appearance, and they were oriented in an isosceles triangle pattern.  The lights exhibited no wing lights, strobes, beacons, or any other light which would be characteristic of aircraft.  The caller is a student pilot, so she is rather familiar with what aircraft look like, and what their lighting patterns are. Suddenly, as all three of the observers were looking at the pattern, they noticed a fourth light, which had suddenly appeared.  The caller will submit a written report.

The husband went to bed, but the wife stayed up and continued to look at the sky with the telescope.Suddenly, she noticed a brilliant, white orb in the sky, bigger that the (apparent) size of the moon, that appeared to have orange dots imbedded in it.  &quot;It was beautiful!.&quot;  She went upstairs to get a better look at the object, but the windows were frozen over, so she went downstairs and woke her husband. She grabbed her binoculars, and watched it retreat in the sky, into outer space, she thought.  She saw a &quot;shadow&quot; of it where it had been.

19960911	19970220	 Arden Hills, MN	 light		SUMMARY:  A bright white light was seen in the night sky. It quickly darted over to the north, stopped, and then took off back south and suddenly disappeared.I was out star gazing which I do often, when I noticed one of the stars was misshaped. It was oblong like a football, slightly wider at one end. Within 15 seconds of when I first saw it, it took off very quickly to the north and suddenly stopped. In about five more seconds, it took off back to the south, slightly faster, and disappeared with its light trail following behind.
19640915	19961225	 Arcade, NY	 disk	sec. to min.	SUMMARY:  Several sitings in the area of rt 98 and Bray road. One saucer-shaped, silent, dull-metallic appearing object travelled over downtown Arcade headed nw about treetop height.Seen by many. Nellie Daully(town operator) receieved many reports.Late summer/early fall before dusk.Object as described passed over town headed in general direction of thr park (nw).The year was probably 1964 or 65-66.I was a toddler but distinctly recall the object passing overhead dissappearing beyond the treetops in the distance. My mother witnessed this, and my sister(3yrs older)-but sister doesn&apos;t recall.The area was a hotbed of activity in the 60&apos;s. My father a physician and formerly, an airforce pilot during Korean war recounts that many of the sitings corroborated ufos generally travelling northbound following rt98. Bray road is one of the highest elevations in the county and people living there and in the area of Lost Nations witnessed several objects. One physician Dr. Oestriche (now deceased) saw lights back in the field and found circular depressions when he investigated the next day. Krueggers, who still live there have mentioned seeing things also. It was so common and widespread knowledge, that people used to park up and do!wn Bray Rd. to ufo watch. The last I&apos;ve heard is that there is a dome shaped building 1/2 way up Bray rd. which is under 24hr guard. Even the farmers next door to it don&apos;t know why it&apos;s there. I hope this old archival info may be useful. It is definitely truthful and deserving of scrutiny. One other point (of potential interest) is that Arcade is pretty rural-about one hour south of Buffalo; the only other interesting thing of note in the vicinity is the West Valley nuclear facility (about 15 miles south ). This was being built in the early 60&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))

The caller reported that she and her husband had witnessed two beams of light to the northeast of their home that appeared to go straight up into the sky, perfectly parallel to one another.  They appeared to originate from behind a hill to the northeast of their home, and the beams were definitely separated from each other. They were looking toward Beaver Lake.  the University at Springdale is to the north. They called the local newspapers and the local airport(s).

19970122	19970122	 Altus AFB, OK	 changing	30sec	SUMMARY:  Object breaking up above western oklahomaAt 3:35am Central time over S.W. Oklahoma a bright object came from the north about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon moving rather slow. It was breaking up into several small pieces in about 15-20 pieces and burning a bright blue and white. It continued across the sky until invisable into the south. The surrounding light was hindering a good view of the object shape.I am a amature star gazer and I have seen the space shuttle reenter at night and a Russian booster rocket reenter (about 8 years ago). This object was about the same speed.I have been in the U.S. Air Force for 4 years stated at Altus AFB Ok.Local and national news has yet to say what that object might have been.

A retired aerospace engineer was out walking his dog, when he was momentary witness to a &quot;very bright object with flames coming off it&quot; streak across the sky from northeast to southwest.  It flew parallel to the horizon, and he emphasized that it did not look like a shooting star.   It flew from horizon to horizon in about 2 seconds, except its appearance was obscured in the southwest, where the sky was obscured/overcast.  The observer stated that he thought the object appeared to be descending.  Its color was &quot;metallic silver.&quot;  Flames were streaming off the nose of the object.  It was much smaller than a full moon.  He said that it looked like an object re-entering from space.

They looked at it for over an hour with binoculars, and in addition to the smoke, they saw a very bright light, which just appeared to hand in the sky.  Occasionaly, the light would &quot;explode&quot; to approximately several times its smaller size.  &quot;It looks like a perfectly round circle that explodes, then gets smaller.  It is very bright.&quot;They have it on video, and they were still looking at it at the time of the call.  &quot;It exploded into thousands of pieces.  It is a perfect circle, with a thousand lights.&quot;
19910515	19970112	 Central Texas, TX	 light		SUMMARY:  Mother relates story of helicopters observing circle of blue lights on ground.My mother told me this story a few years ago and I just now wanted to tell someone else.  I believe every word of it and my mother is honest and has no reason to lie to me. My mother was driving to work at about 6:00 o&apos;clock in the morning.  We live in a small town in the country, and off a few hundred feet from the road(a small country road) she saw several blue lights in a perfect circle on the ground.  The object was trapped by 3 helicopters and 2 more were coming in she said.  She did not want to stay because she was afraid the government would take her or something.  Where this occurred was about 150 miles from Diass Air Force Base in Abilene.  The reason why she is not telling you this is because she died 3 years ago.

I called the office to inquire whether they had taken any calls from individuals on the previous night regarding the big &quot;wheel of lights&quot; that had been reported to the hotline on the night before. The switchboard operator asked Peter if he would like to talk to an individual who had seen the object.  He said he would. The female employee who had seen it was put on the line.  She described how she had been driving to work on the night before, at about 1930 to 2000 hrs., she thought, driving westbound on Hammer Lane &quot;off Highway 99.&quot;  She was looking straight west, ahead of her, and looking through &quot;driver&apos;s window of the car,&quot; when she saw a large, round shaped object circling, or rotating in the sky.  It was &quot;going slowly over the area,&quot; she added, and it appeared to be moving to the west. It was in an area where there is a shopping center.  When she got to I-5, the object was nowhere to be seen. The object, from her vantage point, was bigger than a thumbnail at arm&apos;s length.  The sky was cloudy that night, and she thought she was looking at the object through breaks in the clouds.

Man reports witnessing, with four other people, a long, slender, tubular-shaped object, with a pointed nose, travelling from north to south in the western sky against the setting sun.  It was just above the Olympic Mountains, and they viewed it with a 30-power spotting scope. It looked black, very long, shaped like a missle with a very pointed nose, and it was very prominent because it was giving off a large &quot;smoke plume trail.&quot;  They watched it for 5 minutes, when suddenly it dipped its nose down, descended, and disappeared behind the Olympic Mountains.NOTE:  Could the time of 1750 hrs. be wrong??  It should be 1850 hrs., to conform to the other sighting from Whidbey Island.  Check notes and tape recorded message.  (Written report from Albert Gabelein states that it was 1750-1800 hrs. that they saw the object.)  Ask both parties whether it was light or dark when they saw their respective objects of interest.

19941101	19961226	 Lower Lake (Near), CA	 disk	10 minutes	SUMMARY:  &quot;The Dunn sightings&quot;  Two hunters parked at the end of a fire trail near the highest point in the area observed a bright white light in the distance. Suddenly the light shot up to high altitude instantaneously, then came directly at them. Passed at a slight tangent to them but was clearly visible. A perfect saucer shape, with bubble center surrounded by a white gas that gave it a haloed effect. 400-500 ft up, 1/4 mile distant.Filled a 3X9 scope.  the entire event lasted from 10-15 minutes.These two brothers have hunted the entire area and are familiar with it all.Sitting in their truck above the McLaughlin Gold Mine, where one was employed, they could observe the entire skyline for many miles from the ridgetop.The glow from the lights at the mine was visible below them.  In the distance they both noticed a bright white light.They both thought it was the light from a helicopter coming to the mine as happened occasionally.They watched it for approximately ten minutes when suddenly it literally &apos;jumped&apos; up to a much higher altitude and then proceeded to come directly at them.This was their first sighting and they both describe the event as extremely frightening!They thought the object was coming for at them specifically and they were in a panic.It came at them and veered to a slight tangent from a northwesterly direction.As it got closer they could clearly see the object as it passed within 1/4 mile at an altitude of 400-500 feet.It was a perfect saucer shape with a bubble in the middle and what appeared to be windows in the bubble.The light turned out to be a white gaseous appearing cloud that surrounded the entire craft but did not obscure it in any way.It filled the entire viewfield of a 3X9 variable scope.  The gas formed a halo appearance and no other lights were visible.But it was bright enough from a long distance to be clearly visible beyond the mine lights glow.It flew to the south west passing over Mt St Helena and then turned directly west toward the ocean.Note:  Almost a year later these two men witnessed another sighting of a completely different craft at another location in Lake County.This sighting lasted almost 5 hours.Additionally only a few months ago,(fall 96), they witnessed a strange phenomena on the ground near the location of the first sighting.Described as a &apos;puddle of soft black metallic shavings, maggot-like but not easily described- moving as if a magnet were being passed over themand seeming to grow before their eyes as if feeding on the landscape.They report it looked like something out of a science fiction movie!It was late morning.  One of the brothers walked right up to it.  It was a drizzly day.The object appeared at first to be shiny black water. As the younger brother,(30&apos;s) approached it, the older one had a bad feeling.He told his brother not to get near it and as it seemed to be growing they ran to their truck and left.Another trip to the area will be made soon.Since this materials was in an open area near a ridgetop, we hypothesize it to be some sort of spill,byproduct or waste material from an unknown vehicle or craft. Perhaps fuel related.They kept these sightings to themselves out of concern fror what others might think until I told them about this internet site and they agreed to be interviewed.I will further describe the next sighting in another report and this and the ohter will be labeled the &quot;Dunn&quot; Sightings.

19961203	19961203	 North Bend, WA		5 sec.	Woman is suddenly awakened by weight of cat on top of her.  Suddenly, she sees three rapid flashes of light, that seem to pulse very quickly, and which change color with each flash.  First flash is gold/silver; second flash is blue; third flash is distinctly green.  The flash seemed to be concentrated in, or directed to the uninhabited area to the south and east of her home.  She rushed to window to see what caused the flash, but she saw  nothing outside after the three initial flashes.  Her impression was that the light emanated from a beam, or shaft of light, rather than from a point source.  There was no sound of thunder, and the sky was totally clear.  She awoke her husband, but the display did not occur again after her husband awoke.  The cat, she reports, reacted to the light.The caller and her husband own two businesses in the North Bend area, and they both are responsible people.

He was talking on his cellular telephone with a MUFON investigator (Los Gatos, CA), when he witnessed a formation of three cylinder-shaped objects, in a triangular formation, fly directly over his head, and then split and fly in 3 different directions.The observer described this sighting in detail to the MUFON investigator over his cellular telephone at the time it was taking place. Approximately 3 minutes later, he witnessed eight more identical objects, described to be cigar-shaped and distinctly orange in color, streak overhead. The MUFON investigator recommended the caller get off the telephone, call someone else, and have a second observer come to the sight to see what he was observing. The observer called his wife, who arrived at the cemetary where the observer had seen the first two groups of objects.  They stood for an hour longer, but saw only one other object, that reportedly went overhead to the west into Monterey Bay.  The shape of this oject was not discernible to them.

19960811	19970106	 Owen Sound (Canada), ON	 light	approx 1/2hr	SUMMARY:  Objects began moving in a snake like motion (s&apos;ing) around the stars.I was out on my balcony enjoying a nice cup of coffee with my wife and her two sisters. I am an avid star gazer. I was watching the clear night sky up above.....just lost in itsbeauty. We were outside for about an hour, just talking aboutthe good times. I was looking up at the stars, when an unusually bright group of stars caught my eye. At first I thought it might be orion......then thought they might be satellites....but was quick to change my mind. They objects were very high up...too high to be planes. They began moving in a snake like motion(s&apos;ing)around the stars. This motion convinced me temporarily that they were satellites.....but then they stoped......grew very bright,and changed opposite direction. We were all quite with amazement at what we had witnessed. We stood out there discussing the rational possibilities of what it was that we had seen. As we looked in the direction of where the incident occured......we noticed a slightly larger grouping......of 7. They repeated thesame motions that the previous 3 had...then grew bright, almost joining in a straight line of light, then reversed course as theothers before had. We are still not sure of what we had witnessedthat summer night.....and have not discussed it with others....but I&apos;m certain what we witnessed was not of human origin or of Earth&apos;s current technology.  I am currently a college student, studying to be a computer technician and engineer. I am also interested in working for N.A.S.A when I havecompleted my education. I&apos;m 24 yrs old.I hope I am taken seriously.....this is the first time I have spoken about the incident to anyone.

19950831	19960323	 Reno, NV			Sometime in August 1995, he believes, the caller arose to go to work.  He went outside his residence to start his car, when he looked in the morning sky and observed one peculiar light, larger than the moon, hanging in the sky.  Then, he realized there was not one, but two of them.  They looked like round balls of light with different colors around them.  There appeared to be a square-looking object, which he interpreted to be a &quot;door.&quot;  Then he could see, he thought, something dark underneath the bright light.  The dark object appeared to be saucer-shaped, and black. He got video footage of the object(s), which was aired on Channel 8 in Reno.He will send written report.
19970225	19970225	 Boiling Springs (outside of, traveling on highway), PA		15 sec. approx.	SUMMARY:  Observed unidentified object apparently following AirlinerMy four year old son and I were returning from shopping at approximately 1420 hrs. EST. I observed a commercial aircraft at altitude, traveling in a westernly or northwesterly direction.  I was initially attracted to this as the commercial aircraft was trailing a beautiful con trail.  I took my eyes off the aircraft several times as I was driving, but I continued to glance up at it intermittantly, and suddenly I observed another object following behing the first aircraft at what I would estimate at under 1 mile, although I cannot be certain of exact distance.  First observed second object as it began to glow brightly as if the sunlight were glaring off of it.  Second object appeared behind and just outside of con trail at what appeared to be same altitude and speed, and traveling in same direction.  Found it somewhat puzzeling that there was no sun glare off of first aircraft, and also that there was no con trail from the second object even though it appeared to be at same a!ltitude and airspeed as the commercial aircraft.  Also, this second aircraft seemed to be following much closer than any I&apos;ve ever witnessed within the local flight corridors.  With the recent events concerning military aircraft closing on commercial aircraft from behind and triggering the commercial aircrafts anti-collision warning system, and it struck me as being rather odd that these two were reletively near one another in flight to not have such systems activate.  I observed the second object for about 10 or 12 seconds as it appeared to reflect the sunlight, it then stopped reflecting light and the glare stopped, and I continued to see an obhject but could not determine shape.  Within a few seconds of the glare from the sunlight reflecting off the second object had ceased, I lost sight of the 2nd object.  I continued to observe the first aircraft and it&apos;s con trail as it flew off into the distance.  The best I can estimate, the first aircraft was approximately over or nea!r Gettysburg at the time I made this observation.  I&apos;m sorry to say that I did not observe any unusual flight characteristics such as phenomenal or unusual speed or course deviations.  When I stated a commercial aircraft I was inferring larger sized, it may have been a large military aircraft I suppose.  I just found it unusual that  one of two objects that were apparently at the same altitude and speed, one reflecting sun and one not, and with one apparently following the other, one with a con trail and one without, was a bit &quot;unusual&quot; especially considering there relative distance of seperation!  It&apos;s probably nothing, but thought you&apos;d like to see the report, perhaps someone else has reported something else that will make further sense to someone there.

19961213	19961216	 Detroit, MI		10 min.	A woman called to report that she and her three children had been driving, when they saw three lights in the sky.  They were very bright, and formed a triangular pattern. The mother continue driving past their house to &quot;get to it.&quot;  All of a sudden, the three lights went shooting off in different directions. They chased one of the lights for approximnately 12 minutes.  They &quot;caught&quot; one--it was in front of them--and then the son said it was suddenly in back of them.  She caught a second craft, perhaps the same one they had first caught, and they got out of the car.  Her son at this point said that the object was not a conventional aircraft. The object was round, it had no wings, and was gray in color.  The lights they were looking at were &quot;underneath.&quot;  The mother saw white lights, but she could not saw if they were recessed, or not.  The mother became alarmed by the sighting, so much so that she was having difficulty getting the ignition key into the ignition.

19960125	19960129	 Bartlett, TN			Caller called at 1232 and left a message requesting that the Center call her. Caller was outside her home, with a clear blue sky overhead, and no clouds. She observed 5 contrails in the sky and heard some type of engine noise.  Then she spotted something that appeared to her to be a twin-engine aircraft in one area of the sky, and also a helicopter in the northwest area of the sky.  From her vantage point, they were on paths that would cross, or the aircraft might even have been on collision courses. Suddenly, and peculiarly, the sound emanating from the helicopter ceased!!  Then, she looked back at the other object, which she had taken to be a twin-engine aircraft, and it had a different appearance.  It now looked like a collection of what looked like &quot;slivers of metal in the sky.&quot;These objects, apparently several of them, were &quot;flipping and doing formation flying.&quot;  They did not appear to be going fast, their (angular) velocity slower than a commercial airplane, for example. The object(s) suddenly stopped moving, and they equally suddenly disappeared.  She called the local airport about the helicopter, presumably to inquire who was flying it, and what it was doing. She will send report.

Observer is awakened  from a deep sleep by a most peculiar sound, goes to her window to look out, and spots a bizarre ship hovering near her apartment complex. It had lights on the front, red lights in back, and very bright light in the middle of it. It had both solid, and flashing lights. No rotors, like a helicopter would have had. She is very familiar with helicopters, since they fly over her living complex on their way to a nearby federal facility. The object moved toward the west to another buidlding, turned around, and came back to the area where she had first seen it. It was like no machine she has ever seen in her life.  It was somewhat difficult to see the object amid the lights, because they were so bright, but there appeared to be some body to it.  Also, she looked around her apartment complex to see if anyone else was awake, but there was no activity visible.  She said, &quot;they must have been drugged.&quot;Her late brother had been a pilot from age 16 years, so she is familiar with all types of aircraft.  This object is not any kind of conventional aircraft.

19781220	19961207	 Huntington Park, CA	 disk	20 min.	SUMMARY:  My Father and I watched a silver object, shaped like a diamond on its side.  It hovered overhead then slowly moved to the right, then down, then leftand then up, to form a complete square.  It hovered some more than shot diagonally up and out of sight.I was 14 years old at the time.  It was Christmastime, cause I rember sitting next to our tree watching television.  It was dusk, so there was still some daylight left.  My father was sitting in our kitchen watching the birds outside.  I heard him yell for me to come see something.  I went into the kitchen and sat next to my Dad.  He then pointed out thewindow, up into the sky.  &quot;Watch that silver disc up there,&quot; he said.  The objectI looked at was not exactly round, it was kind of a cross between round and oval.  It was really high up but you could still see it clearly.  The color of it was silver, not unlike the way some jets look today.   As I watched the silver disc, it slowly moved to the right and stopped.  Next it moved slowly down and stopped.  Now it moved directly left and stopped.  And the last move it made was up and stopped.   At the time, I don&rsquo;t remember being really amazed by it, I just thought it was&quot;kinda neat&quot; is how I think I put it then! (chuckle).  As we watched the silver disc just hover in the one spot, it suddenly shot really fast diagonally up and was gone!  Later that night, after I had gone to bed, something woke me up.  I didn&rsquo;tknow what, but I had this strange sensation (not unlike dreaming).  I was being drawn to the back of the house.  So I walked slowly to our back door and pulled the shade on the window.  Normally what I would see is the silhoutte of our backyard trees against the streetlamp.  What I saw instead was a hugh, bright, white, light!   The light was so bright it was blinding!   I was suddenly startled, like waking up from a dream. I hurtled the shade down and ran back to my bedroom!  It took awhile, but I finally fell back to sleep and to my knowledge, nothing else happened.  My Father owned his own agency.  Me, I was a sophmore at Huntington Park High School at the time.

She saw a brightly lighted object streak from left to right in front of her.  (Note direction in other reports.)  It was totally silent.

19820515	19961208	 West Reno (out on old Hwy 40), NV	 other	1 minute	SUMMARY:  Loud boom, so loud shook house.  Went outside to see what happened.  Saw hole in sky cover perfect circle.  Moon in center of circle, full moon only 1/20 the size of hole.  Lots of neighbors witnessed too.  No aircraft or noises after that.Sitting at home in the evening, when a loud boom shook the house.  Maybe a sonic boom.  Not sure.  Ran outside with the curiosity of anyone my age (12) to see what had just happened.  Upon arriving outside, I saw a perfect&quot;cookie cutter&quot; round hole in the cloud cover.  The full moon was in the center of it.  The hole was HUGE!  The full moon was dwarfed by the circle in the clouds.  It is almost like something was there in the clouds and vacated immediately.  Didn&apos;t see any aircraft of any kind.  No lights or engine sounds.  I then noticed I was holding my pellet gun for protection and was also being watched by the  neighbors.  I felt out of place and went back inside.  I would very much appreciate any kind of response to this.  I feel like it was very important.  But I have just found some one to tell that can&apos;t really tell me that I am a nut, if you understand.  Did any one elsereport anything similar anywhere near thattime?   Could be one year off either side.  Could it maybe be explained as a natural phenomenon?   Either way, I would just like to rid myself of the curiosity of the whole event.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))

19970704	19970708	 St. Louis (St. Ann), MO	 light	30 sec. ??	Summary : July 4, around 10:30pm. Shooting fireworks w/children in backyard. Instantainous bright blue light in sky caught my eye. As I turned to look, it appeared to be an oval shaped blue glow just sittin there. Then it glowed a soft orange around the outer sphere and shot through a cloud bank, I could still see the bright glow through the hazieness of the cloud . faster than I could react, or say anything to anyone it was gone , just like that, no big production just flat gone! When I turned to my son who was standing next to me, he was already looking up at me. He asked me what the light was and I knew then that I was not seeing any sort of firework or pyrotechnics. It was flying at around the same altituide a commercial airliner would, but I&apos;ve never seen anything move so quick. And there was NO sound as it shot across the sky .
19970510	19970512	 Provo/Orem/Salt Lake City, UT	 light	2 mins	Summary : Saw a white yellowish light performing vertical and horizontial maneouvers in the northern sky.  At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously.At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white &apos;star&apos; with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large &apos;star&apos; before.  It didn&apos;t twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn&apos;t circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the &apos;star&apos;.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the &apos;white&apos; light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; position to the &apos;center of the clock&apos; position&apos; and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; position. in a fraction of a second.  There was no gradient climb from the &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; positions, even in the other movements mentioned below.It remained for several seconds in the &apos;12&apos; position, and performed a vertical descent to the &apos;6 o&apos;clock&apos; position.  (No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the &apos;3 o&apos;clock&apos; position.At one point in its movements, from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half.
19960815	19970314	 Grand Rapids, MI	 light	20 minutes	Summary : We saw two red dots of apparent unearthly origin.A friend and myself saw a small dot that was very hard to notice at first in the sky directly above us. We were star gazing.  It was very high and it was red.  It wasnt a sattalite or any conventional aircraft.  It would slow down and speed up and most oddly it would make turns of which i have never seen at the speed in which it appeared to be traveling.  After 20 minutes or so it disappeared over the treeline and the 10 minutes later it returned with a second object, also moving about oddly.  They both dashed about for a few minutes, going in triangle shaped motions, then eventually disappeared again, for good this time.  I have told many peopel this story and i was referred to this page by one of them, so there is my story.  I still dont know if it was a ufo, but thats what I believe it was.
19720601	19970714	 Texas City, TX	 light	3 /4 min.	My sighting was a long time ago and some details are hard to remember.One summer nite i was taking my sister to pick up some clothes from the garage of my parents house that had burned down .She was in the garage for some time and i had became restless and had laided my head on the car door from the inside of the car on the drivers side. Iwas looking up gazing at the stars it was a clear nite . Then out of no where a triangle formation of lighted dots drifted across the sky.There was no sound . If i had not been looking up i would have never seen this event.I was startled and amazed at what i was wittnessing .I had to move to the other side of the car very quickly because the dots of lights were moveing at a pretty good drift. The amount of dots or disk that i saw were between 12 or14  moving in a northeasterly direction.The lights did not stop or move in any wierd manner, they stayed on a straight path . Their color was like a white silver more whiteish sort of like a full bright clear moon. Idid tell my father and sister and mother about this sighting and fact on that nite i had also yelled at my sister to come and see but she was trying to get her clothes and didn&apos;t make it out in time to see . I have waited a long time to tell anybody else because most people think your crazy . I also didn&apos;t know where to report such a matter until i recently got on the net and found this site.
0000	19970410	 Near Randle, WA	 light	45 Seconds	Summary : Large bright object moving horizontal in the evening sky, very low, made no noise.A friend and myself where viewing the comet Hale-Bop Saturday  April 5th  near the Cispus River in Lewis County WA we observed a object best described as a very bright light at a  very low altitude about  5,000 to 6,000 ft moving in a horizontal trajectory towards Mt. Adams at a speed faster then a jet but not at a streaking speed, both of us were able to run down the dirt road for about 200 yds while tracking the object across the sky. I have never seen anything like this in the sky. I have watched the skies for many years and what amazed us most, was that there was no sound at all, only frogs chirping. If this was a plane we would have heard jet sounds. I am a computer Instructor and my friend a painter what we saw that night is something we still cant explain. We hope to update our story as we will be going back up this week to hopefully see more and get some answers to our question.
19971201	19971202	 Warwick, RI	 circle	1 hour	Summary : I was watching Deep Space Nine which airs at 12pm when a unusual bright object caught my eye I quickly got up and looked out my front window looking for the object again,it was moving not extremely fast but faster than you see commericial planes from TFgreen airport (in warwick)it moved horizontally(---)which i thought was very strange becuase planes dont move in a straight lines and planes never fly in this area(i know the zones the planes fly in from living here a long time)the object always went in the same direction,then,it disapeared started back from the beggenning and did the same routine about 10-50 times.

19790701	19971223	 Chico, CA	 rectangle	4 - 7 minutes	Summary : A huge solid black mass, silently glided directly over us from the NNE going SSW then did a perfect 90 degree turn directly over us and went due E.  No lights, no sound, just a monstrous huge black vehicle.  My impression was it was like a rectangle.  We only new it was there because it was blocking out the stars (there were no clouds that night), that is what drew our attention to it, blocking out a large section of the sky and it&apos;s movement.  I have no idea how high it might have been although it was at least above 3500 feet.  Myself and my associates were all standing together talking when one of the guys said what is that coming from the &quot;North?&quot;  We all looked and then could make it out, it was awsome.  We were all &quot;on duty police officers&quot; taking a break in our favorite spot where the ambient lights of the city didn&apos;t block the stars.  The north valley is known for it&apos;s clear nights and fantastic views of the night sky.  If we hadn&apos;t been taking that break and watching the sky while we talked we would never have seen this object.  And no, I have not said anything before this time.  We all looked at each other and basically said &quot;what the hell was that thing!&quot;We were all Chico or Butte County Deputies at the time who often worked the same areas of the county/city together.  This location we were standing in was on a sight rise or hill on the SE side of town, leading up to the foothills of the Sierras.  It was away from public view where we could park four or five police cars, drink some coffee and relax for a few minutes without scrutiny or criticism from passing motorists; and the sky gazing was superb from that location. We were all veteran cops as well as military veterans.  I was a combat air-defense control officer in the military and have somewhat of a good idea of what anything man made can accomplish in the air.  This was not anything that we could possibly have built.  I don&apos;t know why I thought it was a rectangle, but I just had that feeling about it.  Whatever shape it was, it was huge!

19970424	19970424	 Coos Bay, OR	 sphere	2 min.	A young mother was standing outside, looking at the stars to the east.  Her attention was drawn to an object to the east that was moving from south to north.  She looked at it with binoculars, and the object appeared to be round, and it was tan and very bright, and it &quot;was moving fast.&quot; (??)  In her words, it looked like a &quot;flaming object.&quot;  The object passed out of sight over the mountains to the north.  ((Note:  There were discrepancies in the report.  At first, the observer reported that the object was large, then she said it was visible when she looked at it with binoculars.))Ten minutes later, she witnessed the same object moving from north to south.  During the second sighting, the object appeared larger and closer.

We have changed the location here, although we may err in doing so.  PD))

It seemed tochange course slightly before disappearing,moving northwest.  This seems to have set itapart from meteorite or firework activity.See above for description.  (blue-green objectmoving east to west in southern sky overthe Alton, IL area at 9:45pmon July 4, 1997.)I&apos;d like to add that it was brighter than anyof the fireworks that neighbors were launchingat the time.  It lit up the yard for a moment --not brightly ... but, more so than moonlightor fireworks.  Slightly less than lightning.The fact that it moved so smoothly and quicklymade me think it was a shooting star ... a closeone because of the &quot;thickness&quot; of the trail.But, it shifted course a little, heading morenorthwest than west, which I found odd.  Thenit disappeared.think is odd.

19970603	19970605	 Spanaway, WA	 disk		Summary : I was out having a smoke when i saw a light in the sky.  I watched it for a while and then decided it was a plane.  i sat down on my bench.  About three minutes later It again this time alot closer.  It had green lights on the bottom and it had a strange blue light going over the ground.  I was so scared that i could not move.  The light went by my house and then it turned off.  The ship then left and i sat there for another 20 minutes or so trying to figure out what hte hell i just saw.  I thought maybe it was a dream, but then my sister came out and asked me what that bright light was she saw out the window.  I now am convinced that it was a craft from another planet.This experience has been scary and interesting.  The only thing i left out in the descriptio above, is that i had a radio on and it started going crazy about 5 minutes before the first sighting.
19970417	19970417	 West Memphis, AR	 light	1 minute	Summary : Two lights merge together due south then proceed rapidly to the southwest where they disappear at the horizonI was driving home, when I looked out my left window and saw two bright white lights,at about 70 degrees in the sky and quite high. In a couple of seconds, they merged together from their side-by-side formation in a curved V-shaped movement. The resulting light moved southwest at an amazing rate,where it disappeared beneath the horizon. I&apos;d say it moved from 70 degrees to 0 degreesin 20 seconds.

It did not have any blinkinglights which I have observed on aircraft before.strangest thing I have ever seen, and I am astar-gazer who watches for such things.
19971012	19971019	 White Tank Mountains, AZ	 light	20 minutes	Summary : Saw bright light past mountains. Looked at it through binoculars. It was very large. Must have been 18 or 19 miles away. Due to it&apos;s size, it must have been a couple hundred feet long. strange orange glow emmited from it. (White Tank Mountain,AZ)I was out in front of my house playing hacky sack, and I saw A light from the White Tank Mountains.  The mountains are about 17 miles away, and when I looked at the light/object it was past the mountains. I had seen this very light about 1 month before.  It is very large.  the color seems to be an orangy color.  It couldn&apos;t have been a star because it was to early in the day.  Me, my mother, and my sister have all seen this before. My sister in very sceptic. she was completely amazed at the sight of the object.  The strange thing is, Luke air force base is laocated only a few miles away from the sighting.
19970626	19970702	 Wendover (approx. 20 miles E of Nv. I-80), UT	 disk	35 sec.	Summary : Object flew towards us from S.E. and then parallel to us at 75 mph. Appox. 8 lights on outer circumference of disk shape, only lights visible.  Rotation of approx. 6 revs per minute.  Object disappeared when last visible light turned off. Lights were approx, 30 degrees apart on outer surface leaving times when only 3 lights were visible.  Light appeared to be coming out of portals.  Structure of object not visible, only rotating lights.Departed Salt Lake Airport by car at 2200 MDT on I-80 westbound at 75 mph toward Wendover, Nv. At 2305 driver saw what appeared to be two close, low flying aircraft, one seen as two lights and the other seen as one light approaching quickly from S.E.  Driver told passenger to look up to see jets.  No noise or visual above so driver looked to S. E. again to see the three lights now flying parallel to vehicle.  Now three lights could be seen to be rotating with more lights being added  from the one and the other two disappearing.  The lights were on the outer circumference of a disk and were rotating.  Rotation was approx. three revs during a 30 second visual.  After about 30 seconds, and into the third rev, while only one light was visible, this light went out and although we looked and looked for the lights, they were gone.  We never saw another thing.  I called HAFB to check on night aircraft operations and determined the 388 TFW was in the general area that night.  I also !checked with the Salt Lake Airport Authority and found that a movie was being filmed, using a helicopter with a camera pod below, outside Tooele, Ut., approximately 80 miles west of our sighting.  I still have not been able to correlate these activities with what we saw.The driver of the car has 33 years experience as an ((deleted)) engineer with a T.S. clearance and in general, with logic, tries to explain unusual occurances away. The other witness is a customer service agent with a major airline at the Salt Lake International Airport.  She has also worked for the ((city deleted)) attorneys office as well as the ((government agency name deleted)).
19970704	19970707	 near St.Peters/St.Charles but too high to tell, MO	 light	3 min	Summary : I was shooting off bottle rockets w/ my friend and i looked up and saw a bright blue light , way too high to be a firework , and too bright to be an airplane.I was shooting off bottle rockets with my friend. I looked up and saw a very distant (vertical distance) ,but it seemed that it was large , blue , hazy circle shape , off to the south. it was a color a little lighter than cobalt. It looked like it was staying still.

19970327	19970401	 Sun Prairie, WI		20 sec.	Woman called to describe her sighting in a park.  She had gone to the park with her son, and she noticed a glint of sunlight off an object, which appeared to be high in the sky, which was clear.  The object was moving from SE to NW, and it was very small.  Its color was either white or silver. At first, the caller, an amateur  bird watcher, thought it might be a bird, but she could see no flapping.The object went in a straight path at first, and it exhibited no contrail, and there was no apparent sound.  Suddenly, the object began to turn, executing a 180 reversal of course in 5-10 seconds. The observer walked in front of a tree, losing sight of the object for a moment.  She called it to the attention of other people in the park, who saw it as well. The object reversed its directionb, and suddenly began to climb.  It accelerated, and disappeared in approximately 3 seconds, or so. She added that the object had exhibited three speeds:  slow and deliberate; it accelerated somewhat; and very fast. She called the Dane County Sheriff&apos;s office.

It was highly reflective and shone brightly.It had a definate size and shape.  It was approx .25 degrees across.  The objectwhich looked to be flying quite high went across my field of view then quickyl spedoff and away.  The object was not seen again.I am a astronomy major at Villanova University.  I was getting my oil changed in West Chester, PA.  On the return drive back to VillanovaOn Rt. 202 North I noticed a bight object flying across the sky, It flew slowly accros my field of view, which was to the South, southeast, forapproximately 7-10secs.  The object then took off at a tremendous speed toward the south.  I continued looking for the object but I did not seeit anymore.  The object was metallic in nature and it had a high reflectance, much like a mirror.  The was a descernable size to the object whichwas approx. 0.25 degrees across and half that in height.  It look to be a spherical object though slightly elongated. The date was 5/5/97 and I noted thetime as 12:15pm by my car&apos;s radio clock.  I was between around 5-6 miles away from W.

19970313	19970319	 Scottsdale, AZ	 triangle	5 min	Summary : Myself, my 12 yr old son and his friend watched a large triangular shape craft with colored lights (red mostly) in chevron design glide over my house very slowly and completely silent.  We watched it as it headed south for quite a long time.  The ship was very large, flying very low and totally silent.I cannot understand why there is not more coverage and concern regarding this sighting.  I always believed there could be other life out there - now I know
19961228	19970630	 Hurst, TX	 light	about 1 second	Summary : I saw a brilliant white ball of lightmoving roughly straight downward very fastprobably about 1 mile away.  It disapearedbehind trees.  No sound.I saw this sometime after last Christmas (I washome from Boston University where i graduatedthis May with a BA in psychology) whilestanding on a friend&apos;s back porch in Hurst Texas,very near (roughly two miles NW of) the bellhelicopter plant.My friend was with me but did not see it.I noticed it in the western sky. It was a verybright white ball of light which shot straightdown much faster than i&apos;ve ever seen anythingshoot straight down.  I have no idea how largeit was, but would guess based on theintensity of the light that it was probablyno more than a mile or so away. It disapearedfrom view behind some trees to the west (probablyabout 25 degrees from the horizon where i wasstanding). I heard no sound during or after seeingit.  There was no flash or sound of an explosion,which I would have expected given its speed,trajectory, and apparent proximity when it disapearedfrom view.The sighting lasted no more than a second, but madean impression on me.  I never thought of reportingit until I ran across this web page.I hope it&apos;s useful.-((Name and e-mail address deleted))will only be active for another month or two.
19971115	19971122	 Lockport, NY	 sphere	25 minutes	Low in the eastern sky over a farming area I spotted a ball of bright light, every once in a while it seemed a ring of color would move around the the lower part of the object but it was too bright to tell any color. It was not moving and seemed to be at the same distance the whole time.  At one point it turned into a  bright orange ball the same size as the bight ball of light. Then a few minutes later back to the bright ball of light. I watched for about 25 minutes altogether.  Finally it turned back into the orange ball and quickly got smaller and smaller until it disappeared about 15 seconds later.  Someone told me that the faster it goes from large to small is the rate of speed it is traveling at. I know for sure now that there is something out there.
19970704	19970707	 St. Louis, MO	 light	1 sec.	Summary : Rapidly moving blue-green in sky over fireworks spectatorsOn the evening in question, I was in the crowd near the Gateway Arch waiting for the fireworks display to begin at 2140.  At approximately 2115, I was looking up at helicoptors that were moving around the river and immediate airspace over the city near the Arch.  At about that time, I happened to notice an object, moving at an extremely rapid rate through the sky, almost directly overhead. The duration of the event was so short that I thought that it might have been some kind of meteorite or something similar.  The object was bluish-green in color, like a streaking fireball in shape, and moving east to west at a speed much faster than any aircraft, flare, fireworks, or shooting star/meteorite I have ever seen before.  The light gave off no observable sound, nor was there some kind of sonic boom or anything of the sort. I commented on it to my friend who missed it and wasn&apos;t interested in my observation.  I overheard others in the crowd in my immediate area comment on the light, so I&apos;m pretty sure that there are others who can comment on seeing the light.  I am writing this, only because I happened to see a report in the news today about a similar series of observations across the river in Illinois.
19930605	19970403	 Economy Borough, PA	 triangle	30 mins +	Summary : Huge triangular shaped object.  Slow speed and low altitude.  Passed directley over my position. No sound except wind rushing past.  NE direction and never swerved, swayed, turned or changed speed. Light shown on ground, briefly.While coming home from working the 4-12 shift as a Police Officer, I noticed an &quot;airplane&quot; flying in the direction in which I was traveling.  After driving a few miles, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still on it&apos;s course. It should have been far away by that time. I was curious, but soon forgot about it. As I was turning onto the final rode that leads to my housing plan, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still there.The PLan where I lived was on the highest point in the area and as I got to the Plan, my visibility was practically unlimited except for some trees.  I could see the &quot;airplane&quot;better at this point and I suspected that it was a helicopter because of the slow speed.  The &quot;helicopter&quot; displayed a search type light at the ground and I thought it was a medical helicopter looking for a landing zone.  I&apos;ve seen helicopters do this in my capacity as a Police Officer, and I was worried that someone might have been badly injured in my neighborhood. While thinking these thoughts, the &quot;helicopter&quot; turned off the search light and continued in a straight line heading directly toward my housing plan.I hurried my vehicle to a point where I figured the &quot;helicopter&quot; would pass over, and I turned off my head lights. Then I shut off my engine and got out of the vehicle to get a better look at the &quot;helicopter&quot;. When I got out of the vehicle and looked up in the sky, I noticed that I was not looking at a helicopter, airplane, blimp or anything I could recognize.  I was looking at a triagular shaped craft with a light at each point, smaller lights were dotted underneath as this was my point of reference, and no strobe lights like a commercial aircraft would have.  The object made no sound, although it seemed to me that I could hear wind rushing past. Faintly, albeit.  The altitude was very low, a few hundred feet or less, and the speed was radically slow. The object was huge.the night was crystal clear and warm, and I saw it but can&apos;t believe what I saw.  It has taken me this long to report it.  I told this story to Mike Frizzell of the Enigma Project and he told me to write to you.
19970724	19970727	 Murphysboro, IL	 cylinder	Approx:5min.	Summary : The witnessed reported to me she saw a irradescent,green,cylindar object move horizontal across the sky going South to North. She first thought it might be a shooting star, but it was moving horizontal instead of vertical.  It was too low to be a plane and she didn&apos;t think it was one at all. It was consistantly in motion.  It streaked across to catch a glimpse and then just vanished out of sight. The whole sighting was appoximately 1 to 2 seconds.She was out on her deck by a pool at night.  She happened look up in the night sky and saw the irredescent green shape.  Temperature was normal for this time of year.  Humidity was low. Sky was clear. The shape was frisbee like.  Possessed no characteristics of a airplane.

19970102	19970629	 Austin, TX	 light	30 minutes	Summary : While viewing M42 through telescope, we witness 3 anamolous moving lights, two with scope, one with naked eye, approx. 10-15 min. apart.On the night of 1/2/97, at approximately 19:15, my husband and I were viewing M42 (in Orion) from our balcony through our 10&quot; Mead LX200, with a 6.7-mm eyepiece.The night was clear, and we had never seen such depth of color in M42 before - it was beautiful.  I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.  I immediately looked at that area with my naked eye, as did my husband, but we saw nothing.  Approximately 10 minutes later,my husband was viewing M42 with a 15-mm eyepiece.  He, too, witnesses a small &quot;yellow-orange&quot; light, traveling at the same apparent speed - although he describes its movement as &quot;erratic&quot;.Again, our attempts at immediate naked-eye confirmation yield nothing.  We continue to observe M42 in the hopes that we will see another light.  This time, we alternate: oneviews through the scope while the other observes M42 with the naked eye - at this point, we have ruled out satellites (&quot;erratic&quot; movement of the second light) and insects flying in front of our lens(none observed with naked eye - lights are in focus through scope - lights are visually quite small).  Approximately 10-15 minutes later (19:45), my husband is viewing through the scope,and I&apos;m watching Orion like a hawk.  With my naked eye, I witness a white light, again visually star-sized, &quot;come out&quot; of the bottom star of Orion&apos;s sword, travel in a small curve or hook, and then travel at a visualangle of about 45 degrees.  It moves in a straight line until it is approximately under the right star of the belt, and it simply &quot;turns off&quot;.  This takes about 2 seconds.The previous night, my brother and his friend were over observing M42 and Betelgeuse (19:00) and reported seeing &quot;shooting stars&quot; through the telescope.  My husband and I are amateurastronomers, and have seen meteors, satellites, airplanes - all of the &quot;reasonable&quot; explanations.  These three lights do not fit in with those explanations.  We have attempted over the past few months to figure this out, but cannot.  I can only say that we both have had an unshakably strange feeling about these observations, and I decided that posting this sighting might bring other observers of this phenomenon to us.
19960601	19970428	 Johnstown, PA	 oval	3 sec	Summary : bright blue-white oval light at high altitude, moving slowly S-NWhile observing celestial objects on very clear night, saw a bright blue-white light directly overhead.

19970808	19970820	 Lynnwood, WA	 other	16 minutes	Summary : Noticed object low and far in Western sky just north of setting sun. Object was round and did not move.Driving West Bound on 164th St SW (6th Ave W cross street)in Martha Lake area of Lynnwood, WA and noticed a bright round object in the setting sun light.  It looked far off in the distance like out over the Pacific Ocean.  It looked large.  It seemed odd that it was large enough to block enough of the setting sun light to be visible and to aparently twinkle (emit its own light).  Intreagued I watched it intently.  It did not move relative to the horizon or the setting sun.  I then turned south on 13th Ave W past ELDEC (Crane) Electronics and lost sight of the object behind trees.  I then kept driving and eventually got to the Target store at Alderwood Mall (184th and Alderwood Mall Blvd in Lynnwood) and the object was still there and had not moved in the sky and still looked the same in terms of the light being emitted and the ability of the object to be seen through the brightness of the setting sun.  I got out of my truck and observed the object for approximately 2 minutes! and said wow it just isn&apos;t moving.  I went into the Target Store at 9:22 pm and the object was still there.  I came back out around 9:45 pm and it was gone from the sky.  I was the only one to witness this-I was alone.  My background-Local person grew up here. ((Deleted)) Engineering degree from UW.  Worked in Construction Management for 6 years, as a engineer for a ((deleted)) company for a year and I am now a ((deleted)) engineer at ((Company and projects deleted)).  I have a lot of aerospace background from a general interest and my current employment.

It was accompained by a crackling of burning sound.We were watching a fireworks display in our town when an extremely bright blue light streaked across the sky.  It was hard to make out any definate shape due to its speed but it travelled with a tail behind it in a east- west direction.  The observers in my immediate party were between the ages of 14-48.  They have professions including study, homemaking, and education.

We were almost home, and as I was looking up at the sky I noticed an intensly lit object.  It was small, because it was at a pretty high altitude.  It looked like two balls attached to each other by a rod (i.e. O-O)  It moved around erraticly with apparently random course.  Then, it streaked off to the south at a speed faster than any airplane would ever be able to reach.  Then it was gone.  I didn&apos;t say anything to my mom, but in later years I have mentioned it to my brother.

19971120	19971120	 Chicago, IL	 other	2 minutes	A couple friends and i witnessed a possible ufo sighting at about 2 am. In the northeast quadrant we saw a bright white object tht caught our eye because it was moving very quickly.  it moved  from the east to the west and stopped on a dime it looked to be enormous and might have been seen from quite a distance .  We pulled the car over and got out to view it better. The object while it was stopped hanged from the bright white light  we originally saw changed to a bluish hue.  The cows in the field on the side of the road seemed to become nervous and started walking around. The object then darted off at a 90 degree angle and went straight up until it vanished.

It appeared trough the trees as the moon or another form of light. After walking around to get a better view through the trees, we could see the object wasn&apos;t moving much, but the posibility of low flying was out of the question. The object was gold in color and oval in shape. No sound was heard from the object. The light from the object gained and decreased in intensity serveral times, making it hard to see but then popping back up out of no where. Then finally disapating completely, and no trace of the object was visible. The whole sighting lasted for about 2 minutes.

19971016	19971017	 Rooseville, MI	 light	1 minute	bright light in the sky, Summary : I was coming down the I94West ramp onto the freeway, when I was eye level with the sky, I looked at the clouds and there was a light as bright as the sun just sitting there.  I closed my eyes and reopened them to be sure I was really seeing this.  It just sat there for a moment then slowly moved south.  As I followed it with my eyes, I noticed an airplane a few hundred yards ahead.  My first thought was it was going to hit the plane (the light was much larger than the plane) then it vanished.  I looked around at the other moterist and they too were looking to the sky.   It was 8:00a.m. so it was bright outside.  The light almost seemed like a head light of a car but 100 times the size and light that it produced.  A minuture sun. The color was yellowish white.I am a mother of two.  I work for a law firm.

19971216	19971217	 Allison Park, PA	 hexagon	3 to 4 minutes	Summary : A long hexagon shaped object crossed the sky just north of Pittsburgh,PA, with heading northeast and moving at a speed that I estimate to be around 50 knots.I saw the object cross the sky on Tuesday night(12/16) at around 7:55 PM EST. It was dark outside but the sky was complete clear except for stars(The moon was still below the horizon). I was looking out the window when I saw what appeared at first to be a low flying airplane, but the shape was odd. As it came closer I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane so I grabbed a pair of binoculars from my closet and headed outside to take a look. By this time the object was coming directly over my house. It was a long hexagon shaped object with 6 large lights and several smaller illuminations. The two lights at the end points of the object were red, while the four lights that made up the center of the object were white. In the inner surface of the object were what looked like a smaller ring of lights, but the were very dim. These lights on the object were different from what a normal aircraft lights look like. First off, they did not blink. Second, the appeared diffused like the light from a LED, not the bright bulb type lights that you would see on a airplane. While the object was at a fairly high altitude I was able to see the actual body of the object. It was definitely a solid mass, hexagon in shape. I couldn&apos;t make out anything on the surface but it appeared to be a dark grey or black. The total time I could see the object was about 4 minutes. It didn&apos;t seem to be moving very fast but it velocity and direction were constant. The object also made almost no noise. I live 25 miles from Pittsburgh Intl. Airport so a lot of plane fly over head at a fairly frequent pace and you can hear the engine drone from miles away, but this thing made only a slight hum even as it flew away. If you would like a more in-depth description or drawing of what I saw let me know by e-mail and I can call or fax your office. I don&apos;t know if that makes any sense or not, or if you have had any other reports from the part of the country. I don&apos;t know what it was I saw but I can say for almost certain that it was not a airplane and not a blimp.
19900701	19970626	 Fontana, CA	 light	3 to 5 minutes	Summary : A bright light in the shy that seem like chopper&apos;s light however without any sound or movement.  The light disappeared into the sky after about two minutes.Back in 1990,  I was going home around 11:00 P.M. and witnessed a police car stopping a car while I was waiting for a signal light to turn green.  As I passed the police car,  I noticed a bright light above the police car at 60 degree angle and coming from a western direction.  At first,  I though it was a police chopper serving as a back up to the police car.  However, after looking at it for a couple of seconds I did not notice any characterisitcs of a chopper.  In other words,  the police chopper was not doing its typical circular patterns that is common to see when looking at a cop chopper, and it was not shining it&apos;s strong bright light on any thing on the ground.  A block later I got home and got out of my Jeep to find two neighbors looking at the object.  However, minutes later the bright light disappeared into the night sky.  Although, at the time I was a college student and it was a Saturday night,  I was not drunk or had any to drink that night.  I was sober and total!ly awake.
19970422	19970428	 Spokane, WA	 light	20 minutes	Summary : Large bright red light, size of Venus at its brightest, observed over Spokane, Wa. at 1:00 a.m. on April 22, for about 20 minutes. Appeared stationary, then moved slowly upward and disappeared. No sound. No apparent explanation.Large bright red (not orange) star-like light (at first described as &quot;Mars&quot;, but was not) seen in northern sky at about 30 degree angle, at 1:00 a.m., on April 22, 1997 in Spokane, Wa.. Too big to be a satellite, and not blinking or moving fast enough to be a plane or helicopter. (It would have been too low to be a plane without some sound.)  No sound accompanying this event.  Clear night.  Full moon.  Light as large as Venus might appear at its brightest, but &quot;stop-light&quot; red.  No other object that color in sky.  Only faint stars in that direction.  Appeared to be stationary, but with continued viewing seemed to very slowly move upward and between two distant stars, about 5-10 more degrees.  Then as I watched, it was just gone.  Obseverved by educated woman teacher and adult son for about 20 minutes in large backyard away from city lights. No drugs or alcohol.  No apparent explanation for sighting, as much as we tried to explain it away.
19971114	19971116	 Olympia (East of), WA	 formation	2 min	Summary : We drove up to my house and looked to the North. At about a 45 degree angle we observed a flight of ???? moving from left to right in a formation.Upon entering my driveway I observed some objects moving across the northern sky from left to right at about a 45 degree angle. They appeared to be in formation. Some of the were trailing sparks...looked kind of like a childs sparler used on the 4th of July. There must of been 6 to 10 objects. I live East of Olympia and South of Lacey in the country. It was very clear. We turned off the engines to the vehicles and could not hear the objects.
19970313	19970319	 Prescott, AZ	 formation	30 seconds	Summary : Saw 5 bright lights in triangle formation in the northand heading southeast at an extremely fast speed.Here&apos;s what I saw.  I was taking the dogs out before bed (I&apos;mnot exactly sure what the time was, around 2100 I think)and I looked to the north and saw 5 very bright white lightsin a triangle (or V) formation moving really fast southeast.Then they broke formation.  The light in the back and below(from my angle) slowed up.  Now I started to wonder what I waslooking at because most planes would keep formation or at leastbreak formation completely.  Never saw a plane with lights asbright as these also.  The group seemed to rotate 90 degrees tothe left and go a little south of Mingus mountain.  I was suprisedthat I couldn&apos;t hear them so I listened harder.  I did hear thesound of a faint rustling in the sky, not like a jet, but of somethinmoving extremely fast through the air.  The sound was a ways behindthem also and did seem to follow them.  I then started lookingaround at two other planes flying.  Sessna&apos;s by the sound andspeed of them.  Also by the red flashing lights.  I saw the lights fadeinto the distance and I headed back inside.  My first notion was whathas our government got up there?  New stealth technology?  Then whythe lights?  I also thought the lack of sound could have been some formof some top secret frequency cancellation system that the governmentis checking out.  But still, why the lights?It didn&apos;t hit home that these could possibly be UFO&apos;s until I heardpeople talking about it on Friday.  Then I knew I had seen somethingthat was definately unexplainable.  At least by me.It was definately not the comet, flair, balloon, or any other thing ofthat nature.Anyway, feel free to call if you want more information

19940615	19971030	 Lemoore, CA	 triangle	5mins	Summary : I saw a large, triangluar shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving about 3-500 ft high in the sky.I believe that it was the summer of 1994. I was sitting in my patrol car at about 0300 hrs., when I noticed movement in the sky to the north. What I saw was a very large, triangular shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving from north to southeast. The craft could have only been maybe 300-500 feet high and there was absoulutely no sound coming from it. I watched in dis-belief and tried to make sense of it. I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn&apos;t that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it. I followed it for about another two minutes as it travelled southeast out of my city limits and Im not sure why, but I decided to stop my &quot;pursuit&quot;. I also am not sure why I didn&apos;t tell anyone about this incident until fairly recently, when I told my wife. I&apos;m a 15 year police veteran, who has seen alot of weird stuff late at night, but I&apos;ve never seen anything like this. There is a Naval Air Station nearby, but I&apos;ve been out there many times and as far as I know, they don&apos;t have anything like what I saw.

We video taped the object assuming that it was a weather baloon but not quite sure.  Over approximately a 30 minute time period we always had the object in sight but kept relocating in order to video tape it more clearly.  At times the flourescent green appeared to be a video monitor or computer screen, reassuring us that it was probably a weat

19970704	19970708	 Florissant, MO	 light	1 to 2 seconds	Summary : Several of us had just finished watching the 4th of July fireworks when we saw a bluish/green light streak across the sky. It seemed to appear from nowhere and disappear just as quickly. Elevation was rather low, about cloud level.At about 21:30 on the 4th of July several of us saw a bluish/green light just streak across the sky. It was only visible for 1 to 2 seconds but was moving very fast from an east to west direction. It appeared that the elevation was only about cloud high. It was moving so fast it was difficult to get a shape but reminded me of a tip of a flame from an aircraft engine. However, this was moving much too fast to be an aircraft and we did not hear any noise. The observers were a family group. Males and females, ages 18 to 45.

19970924	19971202	 Huffman, TX	 teardrop	5-10 sec.s	Summary : Large object seen running N. of FM 1960 bearing W.  It was about 1,000 through 4,000&apos; feet in altitude.  Looked to be between 5-8mi away.I was driving west on FM 1960 about 5 mi.s east of FM 2100.  I had been working on a car and was at this time test driving it.  The event occoured at 20:47.  I was driving and looking at the stars since it was a CLEAR night. (visibility only distorted by minor upper- atmosphere turbulence)  I then noticed the object.  It caught my eye because of it&apos;s intense brightness.  I stared at it allowing myself to accuire a good sight of the object.  It possessed the likeness of a comet.  It was shaped as a &quot;tear-drop&quot;.  It turned out a tremendous light.  Even brighter than the moon on it&apos;s most radiant nights.  It&apos;s light was pure white with no distortion apparent.  There is a tall radio antenna with warning strobe lights situated on it; however, this is not at all what I witnessed.  The object, though described as a comet had none of a comet&apos;s properties; i.e.  A tail, haze behind the comet, small size and the other distinguishing features of a comet.  The object not only very brigh! t but also seemed to be very low (between 1,000 to 3,000&apos;) and able to acchieve great speed.  The object was headed west on about a 280 degree heading.   Although I was driving between 75-80mph it seemed to pull away from me unlike anything I have ever seen.  I attempted to try and keep up with it but I lost sight of it  when The trees alongside the road blocked my vision of the object.   Make note I live near an airport and I used to live near an Air Force base.  I know how planes fly and I know the acceleration an airplane can obtain.  But as this object was 5-8mi.s out.  For an airplane to accelerate such as this thing did it and to dissapear from my field of view it would have to have an extrodinary engine, acceleration rate, and exaust hider (afterburner, it would be needed if this were even to be tried).  I have NEVER seen such a feat.  This event escapes my mind.  I have been made fun of and discredited even by almost everyone, including friends.  Anything you could tel! l me would be GREATLY appreciated!!!! I have tried to find out if something was going on that night, plane problem, U.S. Military trial of new plane but nobody has said anything.  If you have anymore questions I can be E-Mailed at((address deleted)) I would like to try and resolve this matter. I am a very observant person. When I observed the object I was trying to remimber details of it.  I studied it closely in the short time that it remained in my vision. Thank You, ((Name deleted))
19700815	19970318	 Seymore/Farmer City/Weldon area, IL	 disk	1 hour	Summary : Large Aluminun-colored &quot;Saucer&quot;Two couples - both husband and wife.  Large metallic disc, hovering noiselessly atabout 1/2 mile distance.  At least 200&apos; indiameter. No visible seams or antennas on aluminum colored craft. No windows. Many&quot;plasma-like&quot; bright white &quot;jets&quot; of light coming from small irregularly spaced &quot;ports&quot;around the circumference of the craft on its outer edges. Another small &quot;dome&quot; on top of craft...no &quot;dome on the bottom.  In other words...shaped like two &quot;saucers&quot; placed together (one up - one down), with another small &quot;saucer&quot; placed upside-down on the top&quot;saucer&quot;.  Hovered and made rapid right-angle turns.  We followed for 50 miles in car.  It speeded up, gained much altitude, left a contrail, turned an orange color, and wentover the western horizon. The craft alsoslowly rotated clockwise (viewing from below),while we viewed at close range. I reported to nearby Chanute AFB (now closed), but they laughed at our story. None of use are alcohol abusers or use drugs, and we have all been married many years to one-another now.

Looked out the window. saw a SMALL round object at max three feet.  up in the pine trees.  houvering.  Asked a friend sleeping over to look.  She was scared.  watched it.  It moved a bit.  Ran down and woke up parents. By then it was gone.  Never reported because it was so small (didn&apos;t ever hear of SMALL ones.  It had light all around it.  It appeared to make no sound.  Just saw one.  Probably not usable since it was so long ago and no witnesses.I have a Masters in Admin of Law.  Worked as a cop for six years. Now teach high school.  Was riding around with a sheriff (you cannot use this) from the next county five years ago and asked if they ever has UFO sightings.  He said there were some in the 70&apos;s and a couple of officers reported them.  They were flown down to Washington. And when they  came back they reported NOTHING.  My ex partner who worked for a time in West Ellicott, NY, went up to a golf course after reports and found a scorched part.  There was a pond nearby and all the fish were floating on top.

No sound. Sited again on 3/8/97.  Have photos.Formation of lights around 9:0 clock high.  One or two lights in front moving horizontally.Moved downward in a double-helix formation.  Reformed to a v-shape and flew overhead.  Saw again on 3/8/97, about 20 lights in a jumble.  Several lights shot down toward the ground (looking  South).  Have photos of this.  They reformed to a v-shape and flew North.  A few days later saw v-shape formation flyingSouth then North.  Took photos with Stratosphere Casino in background.  There was no sound.  Their lights were a golden/white color. It was very exciting as they flew off to the North.  I felt that it was a fleet and not one object.  It was difficult to judge distance but I was looking over the Las Vegas strip toward the airport.  All of the above was at night around midnight to 1:00 am. Between all of the above I saw at noon a golden orb hovering. When I went in to get my camera (about 10 seconds)it was gone when I came out.

The outside surface had a metalic appearence. Much like stainless steel. The underneath had many interweaved objects. They looked like pipes or metal counduits. The craft was moving over a parking lot that was illuminated by bright lights. The light intensity was magnified by the snow that was on the ground. The craft continued to move away at tree top level and move out of our line of sight. I have never seen a UFO since this incident in 1977.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

19951127	19970704	 Lyons, CO	 other	20 minutes	Summary : Hole (50 feet by 30 feet) opens up on hill side.  Light streams from it along with motor noise.  Closes again and leaves no sign of existence.The following event has been something I have kept quiet about for almost one and  a half years.  It was not until I read an account on this site about a UFO sighting east of my area on 11-27-95 that I realized it might be UFO related.The  phenomena occurred on the night of 11-27-95.  At that period my wife and I would often walk around the hills of our small mountain town during the evening.   It was near 8 PM when we were ascending up a small gulch to the NE of our town.  I happened to look up the east hill slope and saw a large black area.  At that moment a light came on  in the area: it was a large hole in the ground about 50 feet long and maybe 30 feet wide.  It was slightly above us and about 170 feet away.   There was for a short time the sound of a motor, like that of an air-compressor.  The sound was a steady &lsquo;puut puut puut puut&rsquo; like a one cylinder engine.  The light illuminated the sides of the hole (actually it was very bright) and we saw the fresh surface of broken rock around the hole&apos;s sides.  As we continued to ascend the gulch I told my wife that it was probably the site of a new house being built.  I figured that it was a hole for a basement.  The light was bluish-white like that seen in !the older mercury vapor lights.  The motor sound only lasted a minute and once the light went off only come on again.  I assumed that the owner was in the hole doing work.  Other than wondering how such a hole was dug into solid sandstone I gave no special thought to the event.  I almost decided to walk over and look in but decided not to since the owner might not want me on his land.  We ended up seeing the hole from several heights (both from below and slightly above) and several angles as we walked on towards home.  Several months passed.  On 3-10-96 it was a fine Spring morning and my wife and I decided to go up and see how the new house was coming along.  As we topped the rise above the small gulch all that met our eyes was a smooth hillside covered with old weeds and grass with a few small stones.  Nothing appeared to have been moved for decades!  As a child I had read about such things, but that type of phenomena was one kind that I had refused to believe possible.
19790601	19971207	 Alameda, CA	 disk	three minutes	This is a very delayed report: While stationed at the Alameda Naval air station in California. It was I believe early in 1979 when their was much publicity concerning the NASA &quot;Sky Lab&quot;. Much information was being given out via the media concerning the sky lab and it decaying orbit. It was being reported to the public by several radio and TV stations that sometime with a few days skylab would eventually fall to earth. I recall overhearing this on a late news segment. The broadcast also indicated that it would possible to observe the sky lab as it passed overhead. They news gave a general direction in which to look and a general time also. My now ex-wife and a friend went outside to attempt to watch for the ill fated sky lab. It was a very clear and calm night. There was no wind or other noises to speak of. We were watching the sky for about 20 seconds when from the northwest moved right overhead was a giagantic object. So large it covered the entire sky above us. The object was very dark possible either black (or it seemed to not reflect light). or opague. It had some very small dim white light placed in random order around its hull. It was completely silent. We heard no engine noise or any other noise for that matter. The object rotated approx 90% as it &quot;hovered&quot; slowly. it then moved off over the hoizon. As the object moved off we then observed the &quot;sky lab&quot; pass overhead. Which resembled a regular satalite as it passed
19971114	19971117	 Olympia, WA	 formation	10-20 seconds	Summary : Cluster of lights moving from West to East (I think) very slowly.  Similar to shooting stars, but much slower.I was driving on a well-trafficked road in Olympia (Division St.)  I believe this road runs North-South (I would have been driving North), although I could be wrong .  I noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, all of varying size, and all larger than stars.  There were more than five and less than a dozen, but I&apos;m unsure of the exact count.  If I was in fact driving north, then the lights would have been moving from West to East.  I was not the only one on the road at the time, and I know other drivers witnessed the event as well, because many were slowing down and craning their necks.  I also noticed some pedestrians pointing toward the sky in the direction of the lights.  I watched the lights for 10 to 15 seconds before they arced toward the ground as if they were falling, and disappeared behind some trees.  All the lights appeared to be moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  I am unsure of their color, although my initial guess would be white.  Also, my firs! t thought was that the lights were not aircraft lights, as in lightbulbs or some other electrically-produced lights, but were instead produced by flames or heat (which is why I compared them to shooting stars rather than planes).
19970704	19970707	 St. Charles, MO (Outside of St. Louis), MO	 sphere	5 seconds	Summary : St. Charles, MO, before fireworks show. A blue ball (??) of lightstreaked across the sky, I&apos;d say east to west. There was no noise.It just disappeared after about 5 seconds. It did not change direction, justdissappeared.Friday, 7/4/97, approximately 9:15pm, St. Charles, MO. Thisis about 30 minutes from downtown St. Louis.My family and I (as well as probably 30,000 others) wereat the St. Charles riverfront to watch fireworks. It hadjust started to get dark and we knew the fireworks would bestarting any time. I was looking into the sky to the southof where I was sitting and I saw a light streak across thesky. It went in an east-west direction. It was pretty bright. Itwas blue, maybe blue-green. It made no noise at all. Ittraveled in a straight path for probably at least fiveseconds. Then it just disappeared. It did not change direction,it just disappeared. It didn&apos;t even fade out. It was obviouslynot a firework, but I didn&apos;t know what it was. I figured itmust have been a firework, or a plane on fire, or an asteroidor something. But it was really too bright for any of that. Itdidn&apos;t actually have a tail, it was more of a streak of light.Fireworks started 15 minutes later.I am a computer systems analyst. My girlfriend is a cash dept.supervisor. My father is an engineer for McDonnell Douglas. Myfriend is a cab driver. We all saw it and asked &apos;what the hell wasthat?&apos;.Today I heard reports that others had seen it in CollinsvilleIL. But nothing was said about in St. Louis/St. Charles.
19971015	19971106	 Dallas, TX	 light	5 minutes	Summary : My friend and I were driving home from a date, I opened the sunroof to view the moon lite sky.  As I was staring at the stars, something caught my eye.  I saw what looked like a far away star, but was moving around in fast motion.  Ive seen shooting stars, this wasn&apos;t one.  It would move around the stars like as if going through some sort of maze.  I told my friend about it and we stopped the car, and stayed starring at it.  When it got to the point where we couldnt see it we drove ahead to see if we could keep watching.  We were both amazed at the fact that we knew this was something out of the ordinary.  It had to be a UFO.The star looking object was of color white mixed with yellow. Two people observed this.  The object would manuever around the stars in a fast motion.  We saw this on our way home.
19970427	19970725	 San-Carlos mountains, AZ	 light	hour	Summary : A friend who hauls water from an artisian well on the reserve told us about her {friends}, in the mountains. We were on vacation in Pheonix and decided to drive out with her. What I saw was not ships, but what I would describe as.... Electrical entities?? Various shapes and colours of very fast moving lights??? They seem to reply to {J} as she talked to them, moving off at speeds and distances that were unbeleivable. Now here we are miles from anywhere, no tricks, or drugs, or booze. Just a cold night on the messa, the reservation police came, saw it was {J}, looked up in the sky and drove away as quick as they could go. She asked one set of two lights to go find her friend *Bobbee* The lights took off, and came back with a very bright, larger light, that sparkled and turned purple, stuck around for a while, then when a jet came in the area, they all just took off. No sound, no clouds, I have no idea what I saw, but I saw it!??? If anything like this has ever been seen before, please write me back. If you want the directions, I&apos;ll gladly give them up. can&apos;t tell you what I saw, but I know I&apos;m going back to see this again someday.
19970702	19970703	 Davenport, CA	 circle	3-4 sec	Summary : Traveling northbound on hwy 1 towards Davenport from Santa Cruz I noticed a white circular or round glowing object out the driverside window. It dropped slowly in elevation, stopped and then headed to the southwest at a speed that was incredible. It disappeared within a second of accellerating. It appeared to be huge. It turned orange collered at its most distant visable location.Database coordinator--Anyone else see this?
19970503	19970506	 Stafford, TX	 other	10 seconds	Summary : Through telescope,observed amoeba or translucent object containing lights of blue red and white.Seemed distorted though could not see through itObserving Mars through C-8 telescope and 30mm eye piece when an object came into view.  I immediately thought it was odd and tracked it through the eye piece.  It must have been heading roughly due north since I only adjusted declination to track it. It appeared to be like an &quot;amoeba&quot; containing lights of red, blue and white.  It seemed there was distortion and the lights varied in position as if mildly bouncing yet constrained by individual points and still all part of the same object.  That described distortion was nothing like atmospheric and since I spotted the polar ice cap and terrain colors in a town near Houston, it seems odd.  I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and allowed my wife to look into the eye piece as I spun the declination knob at an appropriate speed.  Apparently I had only captured part of the object since she described the end section I had described plus a disc of lights numbering a dozen, half circle of red and half blue with two white lights!opposite each other outside of the circle.  Further, there were two fainter lights inside the circle and one outside towards the trailing section.  She reported sharper detail in some of the lights.  I moved back to view and had lost the object.  I scanned and found nothing.  We looked to the sky and saw nothing.  There was no noise.  We only got a few seconds each to look at it.  I&rsquo;m sorry I let my wife look since I may have been able to track it longer and get a better look.  I spent the rest of the evening tracking airplanes and could not get the same results.  I later heard of sightings like this with terms like &quot;jellyfish&quot; and &quot;translucent&quot; which prompted me to report that I think I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing.  I wish I could have had a better look.Observers:  ((Name deleted)) financial analyst, amateur astronomer and photgrapher.

19970515	19970619	 Palm Beach Gardens, FL	 formation	over 1 hour	Summary : Red flare like lights in formation. Tv footage was very good. Airline piolt reported alt as 10,000 This story did not make it out of Palm Beach as far as i knowI will try to find newspaper acounts of this incident.
19970819	19970820	 London (UK/England),	 circle	0.30	Summary : small circular flashing object emiting different colours, seemingly shaking, plus another circular object separating and parallel to, occasionally joining each other with beams of light.At approximately 11.00pm on Tuesday 19th August 1997 I witnessed a strange event for about half an hour. What can only be described as a circle of lights changing colour rapidly, from yellow to orange to blue to green to red to yellow and repeating.  The circle seemed to be shaking and moving in the air.  It then split into two identical objects as previously mentioned.  Then flying parallel to each other they became joined by beams of light as if they were one large object.  I continued to watch until I realised I had never seen an object such as this in the sky before.  It wasn&apos;t a plane or a satelite, I can say this with confidence as I live in a very tall building and frequently look at the sky at night through a pair of binoculars; and the cloud cover was too low to see any stars.

19700601	19970402	 Columbus, OH	 disk	1 OR 2 MIN.	Summary : I SEEN  A UFO WHEN I WAS ABOUT 13 YEARS OLD. THE YEAR WAS ABOUT1970,  IT WAS IN THE FALL IN COLUMBUS OHIO. AT FIRST I THOUGH I SAW A BLIMP WITH LIGHTED ADVERTISING (THE KIND THAT IS COMPUTERIZED) OFF IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE CLEARLY. A UFO WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND. BUT AS I STARED AT IT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS  ITSTARTED COMING DOWN TOWARD ME  FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED JUST IN FRONT OF ME  ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SAUCER SHAPE AND IT  WAS SILENT, IT WAS GOLD AND THE CENTER OF IT  LOOKED LIKE REVOLVING MIRRORED PANELS THAT NOW I WOULD SAY WERE SOLAR COLLECTORS BUT BACK THEN I HAD NO IDEAL WHAT SOLAR POWER WAS. IT WAS IN THE AFTERNOON ON A CLEAR DAY WITH THE SUN SHINING ON THE CRAFT FROM BEHIND ME SO I DEFINITELY SEEN IT IN THE BEST LIGHT POSSIBLE. IT JUST HOVERED THERE FOR A SHORT TIME ANDTHEN JUST FLEW UP AND AWAY FROM ME TO THE RIGHT  VERY FAST AND OUT OF SITE. AT THE TIME I WAS HEADED FOR A WOODED AREA WITH A BB GUN IN MY HANDS. I DO NOT KNOW IF THE GUN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ITS INTEREST IN ME BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN  THE REASON. IF I HAD NOT SEEN THIS I THINK THAT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE UFO STORIES THAT WE HEAR OF. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY BEINGS FROM OUTER SPACE COULD TRAVEL SUCH A VAST DISTANCE BUT MAYBE IT&apos;S JUST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. SOMETIMES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SECRET MILITARY AIR CRAFT OR TEST CRAFT BUT I SAW IT OVER 25 YEARS AGO AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT SINCE. BELIEVE ME OR NOT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT ISAW. I CAN&apos;T EXPLAIN WHERE IT CAME FROM BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH CONVICTION THAT FLYING SAUCERS DO EXIST. PLEASE POST THIS AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS. IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME ABOUT THIS SIGHTING  I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM. IF YOU THINK THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS VERY SAME TYPE OF CRAFT PLEASE EMAIL YOUR STORY TO ME. derenberg@hotmail.com
19970505	19970506	 Turlock, CA	 light	3 seconds	Summary : I saw a line of bright lights like star, it lasted about 3 seconds and disappeared.About 7:45 p.m. on May 5, 1997,I looked up in the sky and noticed a straight line of approx. 4 or 5 bright lights.  It caught my eye because of the straight line and how bright it was.  I was watching it and trying to figure out what it was, when it slowly started fading away, and then it was completely gone.  I looked around in the sky and noticed there were no other stars out.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it disappeared so fast.
19971125	19971204	 Right outside the Maine state border, NH	 crescent	5-10 SEC.	Summary : Two people driving northbound on Rt. 95 near the New Hampshire/Maine border witness an &quot;almost crescent moon&quot;-shaped object hovering in the sky &amp; glowing bluish-white. The object fell towards the car and then vanished from sight.We were driving toward Maine at 10:21 p.m. on Tuesday, November 25, 1997 when a bright bluish-white object became visible directly ahead and to the left of our car. It was almost crescent-shaped(the curve was not sharply defined). It remained in sight for approximately five seconds and then fell toward the car, increasing in brightness, and then vanished from sight. We looked for several minutes for another trace of the object, but could not find any. The witnesses were two musicians, aged 20 &amp; 18, both of whom are also amatueur UFO investigators who reside in Hyannis on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
19970331	19970506	 Jasper/Hinton Aiport (Canada), AB	 sphere	15minutes	Summary : 4ships, one comet, and a bright light out of no whereAfter dinner at a local restaurant, my husband and I decided to take a look at the sky. We were hoping to see a clear night so we could later come back and photograph the comet.We drove out to the airport farthest from town. The road going in is dirt, and scary, but he grew up here, where I am from the east coast of the states. To me, it was extremely dark out, even with the clear sky.When we arrived at the final part of the road into the airport, we were facing an south easterly direction. In front of us in the sky, were some objects flying from east to west, as best I could tell.I asked my husband to stop, and we got out and watched them fly just under mars and disappear. Later I discovered he had seen two objects closer to the horizon, flying west to east, and flying in a closer formation than what I saw. They were orange in color, and round in shape, but also very far away.They were also flying to fast to be the usual satellite, and too high up to be a plane.I&apos;d seen a light like that last year while looking up at the comet of 1996, while at a pit stop, so I didn&apos;t think much of it.There is a light at the actual airport that didn&apos;t give us very good viewing of the comet, so we drove back onto the road where we could see. We looked around, and decided to go back home for the camera as picture taking would be excellent, and saw a car comingtowards us. He started up the car, and we took off to home, when out of my window, facing mars, I saw the light returning from the west...just one. I asked him to stop again, I see it I said. As soon as I said it, the object turned straight towards usand I started to scream to him, oh my God, it&apos;s coming at us! They&apos;re coming for us! I was so scared, and it seemed to fly from a high altitude to a lower one, at which point I began to get very afraid, and I started to yell at it to go away, that we didn&apos;t want it here, and it couldn&apos;t take us.By the time he had stopped and turned off the car, the object was already speeding away up into the sky, and as he jumped out of the car, I saw the last of it disappear.It happened so quickly, and I was so afraid that we went home to calm down a bit....he still wanted a picture of the comet, and I wasn&apos;t about to stay home alone, so I went with him, and we saw nothing, probably because we were prepared with a camera this time!Just this past weekend, a friend of ours said they saw something similiar flying over Hinton, around three am, when he was driving back from Edmonton.I also note that an earthquake, unusual for this area, happened the morning before our sighting, and was a 4.2 (?) located just southeast of Jasper. I reported this to a an association up here called AUFORA, but I haven&apos;t heard anything from them. We also checked the flight log at the airport when we went back, andthere was no flight recorded, although there was a plane landed from out of town, and a few unoccupied cars.My husband and I are 30 and 24 repectively, and lead fairly normal lives. Both of us have art degrees, and are planning our first business venture as I write this.
19971115	19971116	 Longview, WA	 other	about 1/4 min	Summary : Woke up from sleep, out window over golf course saw dk grey hexagonal object possibly with something thin ( rope-like) hanging down from it , in the air.  Then slowly moved off to the east out of sight from my window.  No sounds heard.Was asleep in townhouse second floor bedroom with blinds open.  Awoke facing  window; saw dark grey object in the air not moving (maybe 50&gt; feet up...difficult to tell).  Object or objects appeared hexagonal-shaped.  Could have been 5-6  objects clustered into one unit; or just one object.  May have had something hanging down from it (rope-like); but I was looking through open blinds that, of course, have cords that run vertically connecting them; so hard to tell.  Sat up to look more closely, and object slowly moved past upper left corner of window out of sight.  Today I heard about &quot;comets or space debris&quot; seen in sky here around 2115  last night.  No one in paper reported this non-glowing dark object appearing at around 0215 this AM.                                                                  I am 45 yrs old, Registered Nurse, female, living in condo overlooking golf course.  Christian , and am not looking for little green men and space ships; just don&apos;t know the ide! ntity of what I saw out there.
19970803	19970819	 Sand Springs (15-20mi. E/SE of), MT	 other	5 minutes	Summary : The object flew almost like a butterfly, very high up (30-40K+), blinking blue and red in four distinct spots as it flew from side to side along it&apos;s E to W flight path.The object flew rather slowly, at a fairly high altitude (it appeared higher than the passenger jets I had seen earlier that night).  It veered, in a wavering motion as if seeing it through heat, from side to side along its flight path, growing brighter then going dim or off at the apex of its pendular movement, then reappearing to the other side of its flight path as it grew bright again.  The movement along the path was reminiscent of a butterfly&apos;s erratic path, but this wasn&apos;t erratic. The four light panels/spots were also similar to a butterfly&apos;s in that the forward two were slightly larger or brighter than the rear two.  The object came from the east, continued west, and eventually veered to the N/NW.  This occured on a completely cloudless night at approximately 2335.  The sighting only lasted as long as it took the object to pass.  The speed required to continually make the turns it was making was what really caught my eye as not being any typical craft. No flying object in my experience flies or lights up like that one did. over; perhaps 5 minutes at most.  My best guess as to its velocity would place it between 200-300kts.  I am a military intelligence specialist and have worked in the aerial reconnaissance field for nearly 3 years.
19971107	19971209	 Austin, TX	 light	30 minutes	Summary : A bright red light in E/SE. Did not move as long as we watched.Leaving house to go to children&apos;s fair. We often look at the stars. I noticed an unusually bright red object in the E/SE and stopped to look. Thought it was Mars but too bright. Too high for radio tower. Blimp? Did not move for over 15 minutes. still there when i had to leave. Haven&apos;t seen since. Family watched. We are military brats so know aircraft. This was weird. My girls got scared because i kept saying that whatever it was it wasn&apos;t normal. I expected to see an article in the paper about it. A nova star? Perhaps it was the planets aligning that night? It had teh steadiness of a star or planet but it was very bright. At one point there seemed to be three interior lights, a little less bright. I thought it was my eyes but my wife and two kids saw it too. I went to California a week later and told a friend who said a similar light was reported in Santa Barbara on NOv 15 but it was reportedly a rocket launch. Maybe so, but what I saw was not a rocket launch.

19860411	19971120	 Aswan (Egypt),	 disk	1 hour	Summary : Sky show of approximately 30 ufos &apos;cavorting&apos; for 1 hour over Nile river at Aswan,Egypt.Myself &amp; 2 others witnessed a l hour &apos;sky show&apos; of round bright objects overhead.We were on the top deck of a boat on the Nile River at Aswan, Egypt. We were with a tour to see the event of Haley&apos;s comet leaving earth that day. It was too hazy to see the comet,so we watched the clear sky overhead. Lights started to appear &amp; move at great speed in all directions &amp; angles. We counted at least 30 or more. It was like play, as there was no pattern to moves. They cavorted all around each other. This lasted 1 hour. Just before dawn,about 5 am, one craft broke away &amp; swooped down towards us at great speed.  It did a pass over our heads &amp; disappeared into the dawn sky very fast. It showed us a definate round flat disc as it came close. It appeared like a celebration at the exact time of the comet&apos;s last view from earth. It was awesome. The observers were the Tour leader, myself a registered nurse &amp; another registered nurse. I have observed other ufo displays similar to this, but have never seen the disc so clearly or low. In the dim dawn light, it appeared kind of brownish colored. It moved too fast to see any other details.
19850630	19971107	 San Diego, CA	 light	4 seconds	Summary : Man driving car with nephew enveloped in white light of high quality. Man observed no shadows even under dashboard. Man could not look above nephew&apos;s knees or  see outside vehicle though tried. Man  not scared about possible accident. Nephew remembers nothing even though he said &quot;What was that.&quot; immediately after event.Man was 36 years old and enjoys daydreaming. State employee. Prior to the event I had said to myself that I travel this section of road when going to work but this was a different time of day. Felt very alert during event , as if taking a college final exam.The event lasted more than 4 seconds because I did so much thinking while it was happening. Estimate 14 seconds based on all my thoughts. I remember thinking during the event that this light was from a star that had been engineered by intelligent  life to improve the quality of light above the quality of sunlight. Just thinking this takes 3 or 4 seconds. My nephew was 15 years old and never had any dreams he could remember. His first dream he ever remembered was when he was about 23. I slept well that night. I am baffled by the event. It isn&apos;t logical. When I drive I sometimes look off the road for 2 or 3 seconds. 4 seconds would be a little dangerous and that is why I feel the event took 4 seconds. The light came on and ! went off instantly. My nephew&apos;s feet were positioned such that his toes were slightly pointing towards the toes of the opposite foot. His heels were touching his seat. This knowledge takes time. Also,  I spent at least 7 seconds trying real hard to see any shadow. I was aware that I could not see through the windshield but wasn&apos;t scared.

19950519	19970419	 Glendale, CA	 triangle	1:30	Summary : Girlfriend and I saw three red lights forming a triangle shape moving north. My first thought, Helicopter, but no sound was heard, from anything, when I think about it.approx (3) white smaller lights traveling with it. I&apos;m starting to wonder if we were looking at something that , maybe..droped us off?I know how that sounds. This is gut feeling purely.First, this is all in retrospect, accuacy would require meeting with ex-girlfriend due to my lack of memory regarding anything prior to that sight.Sholl Canyon Park, top of Glenoaks Blvd, in Glendale, CA. A park is there where we would go to spend time  together, ie, the view..a couple thing. I recall being in the middle of the street with her, walking uphill, it seems we both recognized it at the same time.  Three points of lights (all red) forming a triangle shape.  We were walking up hill maybe eastbound  facing the mountains, Mt Wilson to be more accurate.  What got our attention was my saying, &quot;shsss, I can&apos;t hear anything&quot;  Approx; (3) other white lights were in it&apos;s immediate vacinity. I say approx, because the Burbank Glendale skies are always lit up considering the Burbanks airport. My closest comparison would be this description. I though maybe it was three different helicopters flying in a triangle formation.  Being that the lights were lower that the top of Mt wilson, that tells me it was very close ( a few miles if that) Only no blinking lights that usually gives us a human identification. I don&apos;t know if yo!u could see through the center   because it was the same color as the backround mountains, which is black. Anyway we both stood like dazed children, lost in the middle of the street. And watched it move slowly north untill it looked like it vanish behind Burbanks city lights. not once did we here anything we could associate with what we know is in our skies.  And for some reason I dismissed it and labled it three helicopters., because if it wasn&apos;t three different light sources generating that triangular or greater than sign &quot; &lt; &quot;  tilt that about 90 degrees, so that the bottom light is where the rear propeller would be a single craft. If it wasn&apos;t 3 choppers, then it was truly massive in my eyes. No sound what so ever, no wind no traffic, no nothing but us talking and saying &quot;look at that!&quot; &quot;what is that&quot;? &quot;shhh, let me listen&quot; In retrospect, I wonder, is it a valid possibility, ...ok, hear it go..that we were looking at something that dropped us off?..I&apos;m not mental or at lea!st no ones labled me that, yet. I say this because, we simply did not have the excitement that I feel now. It&apos;s like remembering a faint dream, or just residue of a dream. I need to speak to my ex-girlfriend, (Sandie) I know she remembers it. She said &quot;it my first  sighting&quot;
19970919	19971010	 Seattle, WA	 other	1-2 min	Summary : On the night described above, We were getting ready to leave a freind&apos;s house in West Seattle. I was the first one out the door. While the others were still inside I looked up at the stars for no particular reason. In the northwest sky, just above the big dipper I noticed about 6 orange amber dots in a V formation moving north above the big dipper. I told the others &quot;hey come check this out&quot;. One dot in the V seemed to be moving in towards one leg then back out, yet keeping pace with the formation. We moved to the backyard to get a better look. As this formation started to fade it seemed to rotate into a circle formation just before disappearing. The formation definitely seemed as though it was very far away (not in our atmosphere), and possibly leaving our planet. I have seen shooting stars and satellites many times before. This was not one of them.

19970313	19970710	 Phoenix, AZ	 triangle	3 minutes	Summary : Unexplained Arizona SightingAt approximately 8:45PM I went the front yard of my Phoenix home which is located in the southern part of the city, an area called Ahwatukee. I looked to the east and saw a very strange looking craft flying (?) very slowly in the sky. It was moving away I assume as it was getting smaller. It was very visible against the Superstition Mountains. It moved slowly from north to south and back again in what appeared to be a ric-rac pattern. It was quite large, I agree with the others who put their arm up and measured with a closed fist. It appeared triangular in shape, I related it to a &quot;squashed&quot; pyramid. I saw three very bright white lights, one in each corner and one at the top of the  &quot;pyramid&quot;.  In the center was a very, very bright pulsating red light, bigger in circumference than the three white lights. I would describe the white lights as three powerful strobe lights. We watched the object for several minutes and we amazed that something that large could move so gracefully! and so silently. We could hear no sound at all. It gradually faded into the south east sky.

19970323	19970325	 Nederland, CO	 other	2 minutes	Summary : Group of Celebrators of Vernal Equinox are visited by dimmensional craft .Sunday evening, a group gathered to welcome in the spring while also witnessing the lunar eclispe and the comet, had a fly-by at tree-top level.What we saw appeared to be 15 phantom craft thatwere shaped to look like &apos;oragami birds,i e;teridactle.Approximately 1/2 of the group saw the first fly over andbelieved they were seeing birds, large birds.  Othersthought they were UFOs. The other half of the group immediately began looking in the sky for the objects. Within 30 secondstwo of the craft return moving east to west at 15 feet above the groundand dance, move in and out away from each other, separate with sharp turns, one left, one right, and then in perfect formation, depart into the northwestsky at tremdous speed disappearing.. The caft also had two red identifying lights undeneath the wings. They were luminous, as if litonly by the moonlight.  They were completely quiet and fast.  The writter has seen Large orange balls of light which were believed to be UFOs in the past, but these ships/craft were dimensional-see-thru to a degree.  ONe witness who was standing awayfrom the group with the writter, thought she was seeing someone flying a kite-the kind used incompetetion-two handed.  She remarked to the writter that the kite had little red lightson it so the owner could see it.  She hadn&apos;t heard any word from the group and the writter turned his head just in time to see the craft to the left, turn to the side and then disappear.The writter mentioned to her that there wasn&apos;t any wind.   This was around 8:45pm in a small city park without lights nearby to disturb the evening events of the eclispe and comet.  The writter talkedto most of the group who described the event as it has been written here.  The witnesses were business owners, professional Spiritual Teachers, Artist, Musicians, and everyday people.There was no alchol or drugs at this event, and was a Ceremonial Gathering.

19970704	19970709	 Alton, IL	 light	A few secs.	Summary : This report is being entered for an aquaintance of mine who told me to contact this sight and inform you.  He saw that &quot;blue/green ball&quot; on the 4th of July.  He explained pretty much what the radio reports had said.  He said most of his family saw it.  He explained what he saw without even hearing the radio report.  After he told me what he saw, I told him that he matched the reports.  He is POSITIVE that it wasn&apos;t an airplane or a firework.  Other than that, he has no idea.  It isn&apos;t really that big of a deal to him.  He could care less.  I just find this facinating. Here is an additional note:  One of the crew of radio station KMOX in St. Louis also saw the light in the sky.  He saw it while station out on the KMOX building balcony as he waited for the Fair St. Louis fireworks to begin.  Try and contact him for more info.  They have a website.  Just search for KMOX.  Thanks. Note:  I did not see it.
19970730	19970807	 Lake Winnibigoshish (North Central MN), MN	 other	2-3 min	Summary : Brite orange glowing object passed overhead.At 12:30am on july 30 1997 while watching a meteor shower on the shore of Cutfoot Sioux I observed a object that appearied in the south east sky. At first it was a small orange body giving me the impresion that I was looking at another meteor but the object just got larger and brighter, after seeing the object grow in size and brightness it continued to travel across the sky with a slight wobble in it path (like viewing a object through hot air). This wobble lasted for about 30 seconds then it continued to travel in a stright line. Its speed also slowed down as it crossed the sky. As it passed overhead the bright orange glow started to disapate. This allowed me to make out a flashing light on the upper surface of the craft the light flashed about every second. The craft passed overhead at about 10,000 feet. As the craft disapiered into the trees behind the campsite I heared the slight roaring sound of jet engines. Flight path was from the south east to the north west. No sonic booms. are we test aircraft that can fly after entering atmospher?
19960405	19970317	 San Diego, CA	 formation	60 seconds	Summary : Two military members sighted two red lights north of downntown San Diego.The two of us were in a position on Fifth Ave in downtown San Diego&apos;s Gaslamp Quarter about two blocks from the convention center.  We were on the first floor of a building on the south side of the street.&gt;From our angle near the window, we could see over the top of the buildings to the north of our position.  People on the street were screened by the opposite buildings, and people farther inside the room where we were could not seeout over the buildings due to the low overhang of the window.Both of us, at the time, were in the Navy base stationed in San Diego.  Both of us held jobs in navigation. We were usedto using our eyes to identify far off lights. I have heard over the previous four yearsmany stories from veteran sailors, of many instances in the last few decades that ships have actually followed {or been followed)by UFO&apos;s on the open sea.  Before this happened, though, I was unsure of the truth to many of the stories.  Whilelooking to the north over the buildings across the street, I noticed two, bright red lights up in the sky.  What caughtattention is that one of them moved back and forth across the sky in an extreme fashion, though the arc of movement wassmall, maybe two or three degrees.  The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.  During that time the two lights would hover for a few moments and then move in formation.  At the end, they both accelerated away at a very high speed. Aftertalking about it for a few days, we soon dexcAfter we witnessed this, we looked around to see if anyone else had been watching.  As mentioned before, we were the only onesthat had a vantage point.  We tried to think of any possible explanation for the sighting. We quickly eliminated jets orhelicopters, celestial bodies, or reflected light.  We had no idea what the lights were.  At the time, I did not really know anybodythat we could tell.  I recently bought a computer.  I soon found this site.  I decided to let you know about the event, albeit late.

19960807	19970103	 West Manchester, OH	 unknown	1 min. ea. time	Summary : 2 bros. saw an object in front of S. window appear to come from sky and make flashes of light two different times, then shoot awayTwo young teen brothers saw an object appear before their S. window twice as they were in bed ready for sleep. Each time the object seemed to come in front of the window from the sky. It flashed continually while there and after 1 min. seemed to shoot in a diagonal direction back into the western sky each time.Each stated they shot away like a check mark.  One thought maybe it was car headlights shining in , but didn&apos;t hear a car engine outside at the time. The other one stated he thought it appeared as bright as lightening and thought it was. There weren&apos;t any storms in the area at that time . It was a dry period.Both times it appeared as a white light about as bright as car headlights.It did not make any sound according to both teens. No drawing is included.

19970317	19970321	 Aquaduct (near, over desert, before entering California), CA	 triangle	1-2 min.	Summary : Flying Westward in a UAL plane over the desert near the aquaduct before entering CA, another UAL plane approached and passed beneath us. I noticed its approach and then realized that it had a unusual, triangular-shaped aircraft flying close and to the left of its tail.  This craft? was about 1/4 the size of the UAL plane, triangular-shaped, flat, light grey color. Why?On Feb. 17, I was returned from Chicago on a United Airlines flight to Ontario, CA at about 10AM in the morning. We were flying at about 32,000 feet and the weather conditions were very clear.  Approaching us from the south going north and a bit easterly, I noticed another aircraft flying beneath us.  I am no expert, but I could identify the aircraft as a UAL aircraft. What originally got my attention was that it didn&apos;t seem too far beneath our flight and it seemed so clear because of the lack of clouds, dust, etc.  Then, I noticed that something (another craft?) was tagging along with it, rather close and off the left side of the UAL&apos;s tail.  When I looked closer, I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was or why it was following so closely.  I am not sure of the model of the UAL aircraft, but the &quot;unknown&quot; flying with it was about a quarter of the UAL&apos;s size, triangular shaped, point forward (but the forward point was slightly rounded toward the tip).  Its color was a flat, light g!rey - not shiny as a usual, unpainted aircraft would be.  It was as though the two crafts were flying in formation - that close.I keep them plain in sight until they had passed completely beneath our flight.There is probably a logical explanation for this, but it seemed very strange to me and when I review the sight in my mind, it still seems strange.   Others on the plane may have noted it, but no one else mentioned it.  I was sitting in a row next to a window, just forward of the leading edge of the aircraft, by myself.  My husband picked me up at the airport in Ontario and I mentioned it to him right away.  He guessed maybe it was some kind of target or balloon, but it did have some depth to it, yet nothing on top that I could see which might be like a raised cockpit area, nor did it have any tail(s) or projections, nor any indentation on the back edge like I have seen on some experimental aircraft.  Strange color, too, not too noticeable in the distance and if it had not been so clear, it might have disappeared into the desert sands and dust.  If there is an obvious answer to this one, I would appreciate some feed back.  Thanks

In the northeast quadrant we saw a bright white object tht caught our eye because it was moving very quickly.  it moved  from the east to the west and stopped on a dime it looked to be enormous and might have been seen from quite a distance .  We pulled the car over and got out to view it better. The object while it was stopped changed from the bright white light  we originally saw changed to a bluish hue.  It looked as though it was hovering over or near EROS Data Center. The cows in the field on the east side of the road seemed to be come nervous and start walking around.

19610801	19970330	 Subic Bay (Philippines),	 circle	30 min.	Summary : Looking east about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon, I saw this starlike object at a very high speed. There was only one light which is the bottom of the craft. The object was round as I can can see it from below. It was at night so I cannot tell what the upper portion of the object look like.The object was coming at a very high speed and stopped over us.I was amazed by this object, traveling at high speed and made a suuden stop and hover with no overrun. As it hover us, the object turn on its bright light and I could see clearly for about a mile. It was like daylight with no heat.I would also like to add that I did not hear an engine sound from this object and thats what scared me. I thought to myself that this object is not from earth. Also, I have kept this a secret for 35 years, because I don&apos;t know what it was until last summer I saw on the television a special onUFO sightings. It was an astronaut orbiting around the earth who saw it first coming towards earth and I was the second one to see it here on earth. I don&apos;t Know if there are more people saw this on earth.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))

It was (frome the positioning of the lights) a triangle shaped object. At first we thought it was a plane but then we realized it was hovering. It had about 5 white lights, and 3 red lights, and one light that seemed to revolve around the craft. we could not tell the size but I don&apos;t think it was too big. About the size of a normal air craft. We pulled over to get a better look at it. It stayed put for about three full minutes untill we got out of the car. When we got out of the car, it started to move, slowly at first, then quite rapidly, untill lightning brightened up the sky and it disapeared. I was starting to get stormy.

19631123	19971121	 USS Kearsarge (at sea, out of Japan),	 chevron	5 minutes	Summary : Observed 5 lights in a inverted &quot;V&quot; rise from the horizon, hover for a few minutes and then sink back down below the horizon. We were at sea on our way back to the U.S. from Japan. Lights were simular to the Phoenix &quot;V&quot; lights.Me and my friend M. B. were walking accross the flight deck, I don&apos;t remember why anymore. It was at dusk but not dark yet. We first saw a bright light on the horizon directly behind the ship. It rose up and then there were 3 which continued to rise to 5 lights. They stayed there for awhile not moving or anything. I told my friend I should go get my camera but he said the lights would be gone by then. Shortly after that the lights descended to below the horizon. We went the the CIC room and asked the radar operator if there was anything behind us, he said no. We never said why we were asking or said anything about what we had saw. I can&apos;t remember that we ever talked about it after that because M. said no one would believe us anyway and I agreed. Until I heard about  the Phoenix lights on 3-13-97 I haven&apos;t mentioned this to a whole lot of people. As to when this happened I am thinking it was 3 days out of Japan and the ship was traveling about 30 knots. It was a warm night as I remember. I don&apos;t remember that the lights flickered but do remember that they were white.
19970422	19970422	 Worcester, MA	 egg	30seconds	Summary : It was a bright white/Yellow light, moving at an incredible speed.  Too fast for any plane Went from west to East, The White light would dissapear and then reappear, but it was not moving behind a cloud.  The back had 4 very close together lights.  About 5,000 ft. high.  It was egg shaped, and none of the lights were blinking.  No E.B.E.  encounter was experienced.The craft was egg shaped.  Had a bright light on the side of the craft that was white/yellow.  The light would fade out and dissapear , and then reapper, we know it was not a clould in the path of vision because none were present at the time.  From the rear of the craft there were 4 lights closely together, they were tiny compared to the one on the side, and they wren&apos;t as bright.  The light on the side when it went out would reappear half way across the sky  so it was moving at a very incredible speed much faster than a plane.

19801201	19970710	 Franklin (5 miles south of), TN	 rectangle	3 minutes	Summary : Close encounter/Franklin Tn.Coming down Old Hillsboro Rd., in the winter of 1980, I saw a very brilliant light. It was low to the ground, sort of shadowing the top of the trees. In other words the craft was following the contour of the landscape. As it got closer the light divided into two lights of which they appeared to be some type of flood light. It also looked like shafts of light the farther away it got. It proceeded to come in and the closer it came to the road the lower it got. I was so amazed with the sight that I stopped the car and got out, my wife was in the car with me. I had completely cut the motor of the vehicle off. This craft was flying soundlessly over the road and us.  It was shaped like a rectangular box, with a slanted plexiglass looking windshield. It was moving very slowly, and my wife was telling me to get into the car and lets go. It was a full moon night and we both saw the ufo very plainly. Not like some kind of light in the sky, we saw the entire vehicle. And I have not been the same until this very day. My wife and I are not mental patients and have never been. We don&apos;t drink or do any type of drugs. We attend church regularly and are the parents of four children.
19970313	19970314	 Kingman, AZ	 formation	6 Minutes	Summary : 5 BRIGHT orange lights flying in a V formationAround 7:30 p.m. my husband first observed 1 light moving across the sky in a SW direction.  No flashing lights just steady.  I saw it also.  30 min later he was looking NW in the Hale-Bopp comet direction and saw a fuzzy light above the horizon.  Too late for the comet so we got a pair of binoculars and WOW.  5 BRIGHT orange lights in a V formation.  Not moving at first and then they were moving very slowly.  We went to get a better view and they were gone!  Where we live they would have been flying over the Lake Mead area .  Possibly Red Lake.   My husband and I are in our 40&apos;s.  We own a taxidermy business.  We are interested in astronomy so we are usually looking at the sky.  We know a plane from something wierd.
19970320	19970320	 Whitefish, MT	 light	5-10 secs	Summary : orange lights (not shaped likeaircraft) about 1000 feet overhead followed closely by jet (wingsvisible naked eye).  Only soundsof one aircraft.While viewing Hale Bopp in NNWsky, noticed an orange light moving quickly with an aircraft following closely behind movingwest to east.  The second object was clearly an airplane with wings, fusilage, runninglights-- visible with naked eye (andbinoculars) and sound of jet engine.Only one engine noise heard.  The orange object appeared to have 3 smaller orange lights associated with it, visible in binoculars only.These orange lights were closer together than the running lights ofthe trailing airplane, and were ina straight line.  They never seemedto move relative to one another.No visible structural bodyassociated with orange lights.The sighted plane and lights wasabout 500-1000 feet above theground and maybe 1000-2000 feetaway.  The sighting was made in anarea of tall trees, and moved quicklyout of line of sight. The aircraft trailin lights was extremely close tothe lights it followed-- at arm&apos;sdistance about as far apart aswidth of a fist.Towards end ofsighting, the space between closed a bit.
19970403	19970412	 Melbourne (VIC, Australia),	 egg	10 seconds ?	Summary : At aprox. 20.45 I noticed 2 light emitting pinkish egg shaped objects n/w of my position. They were aprox 50 miles away travelling extremely fast thru a 90 degree arc in aprox 10 sec. One turned sharply right then sharply left back to its  original course. The other followed seemingly to the millimetre. Finally at about s/w they turned right &amp; disapeared into the distance. I rang the Victorian UFO Society who had received reports of UFO&apos;s in the areas we viewed 40 to 50 miles away. My son also witnessed them. Too fast &amp; cornered too sharp to be anything we Know.Just prior to closing shop I had been informing the boys about comet Hale Bopp which should be visible at the end of the month; this conversation natuarally induced me to look at the sky once exiting the factory. The first thing which I believe caught the corner of my eye from the N/W was the speed of the two objects then the colour. I stared at them trying to define what they were. My curiosity turned to astonishment when one object turned hard right. ( I then yelled to my son &quot; check out the pink lights&quot; which he sighted directly without assistance) the object then banked hard left to its original course. To further my astonishment was the second object which followed the first through its flight path seemingly to the millimeter as if they were playing follow the leader. The objects continued on their course until they were aprox s/w where they turned right and rapidly disapeared into the distance.1/ Due to comprehending(as best my mind can) distance to the nearest star 4.2 LY which may support planets  I have never really believed in UFO&apos;s. Now not so sure.2/I am an amatuer astronomer &amp; therefore familiar with the night sky; I know the differance between stars,planets,satelites,lights &amp; reflections,planes, balloons, distance etc. These objects were definately none of the above.3/I would estimate these objects to be aprox 50 miles away.4/Today I received notification of one sighting in Werribee &amp; 2 sightings in Melton verifying our sighting and placing the objects at the same time and flight path.5/They travelled thru an arc of about 90 degrees in about 10 secs aprox 50 miles away.Too fast for anything known to me.6/They were at aprox 40 deg altitude.7/ They cornered to sharply for anything known to me. Very direct 45deg right/45 deg left- no arc.8/Referring to a map with the information available it is possibble they did a Zig-Zag turn to avoid flying directly over Melton or another small town in that proximity.9/It was possible to see they were solid egg shaped objects emitting a pinkish glow.10/They were to far away for sound if they making any.11/Both I (age 40) &amp; my son (age 20) believe what we saw to be controlled flight, flying solid objects without obvious propulsion  outside the limitations of anything we know.

19970324	19970323	 Manassas, VA	 formation	20-25 secs.	Summary : Seen 4 lights, high speed, very high altitude in the Manassas, VA area.I was outside walking my dog and observing the lunar eclipse around 11:20pm, I had been outside for about 20 minutes.  I was getting cold and it seemed like the eclipse wasn&apos;t really getting &quot;full&quot;, I was getting ready to head in and I noticed a very faint light, like a blur, kind of like when a search light goes across the sky.I looked back up and I seen 4 very soft or faint lights directly overhead and very high up.  I looked up with my binoculars to get a better look and I could see 4 lights, shaped like a triangle with 1 of the lights sort of trailing off the back right one, closer to it than the rest were to each other.  I watched them through thebinoculars for about 10 -15 seconds before they were out of sight.  The whole thing happened in about 20 - 25 seconds.  The lights were very faint sort of a hazy yellow color.  The sky at the time was crystal clear, about 10 minutes before the &quot;sighting&quot; the last of some clouds had passed by.  In comparison to any airplanes flying aroundtonight these lights were probably 3 or 4 times as high and 10 times faster.  I didn&apos;t hear any engines.  The whole thing is a bit of exciting also a bit of alarming, its the first time I&apos;ve ever seen something in the sky and couldn&apos;t figure out what it was.  It might have been military stuff but I don&apos;t think so, it was really very fast.I would just like to know what it was, I figure with all the people observing the eclipse tonight someone else should have seen it too.  If this service hears of someone else seeing it please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks.

19781101	19971017	 Mooresville, IN	 other	15 min.	Summary : a bright object follows 2 women home and gives a showMy sister and I were heading home from work to her house,when we saw a very bright object out the passenger side window.it looked like a small sun and was heading in the same direction as we were which was east. We were on a straight country road and the object kept pace with  us.When we turned north the ufo turned north also.As we pulled into my sisters driveway we were facing east again and the ufo was over her backyard. We walked to the back clutching each other in an arm lock and standing in awe we observed it hanging motionless in the sky.It seemed to be putting on a show just for us because it split in two parts and then three forming a large triangle in the sky overhead.Each time it split it became as brilliant as the first object.There was no noise detected . All the objects started to rotate in the sky keeping the triange shape. We kept asking each other &quot;Did you see that?&quot; Finally the objects moved slowly off to the south and disappeared. We had a house full of peo! ple inside and we were so much in shock that we didnt go to the window and tell them to come out and see. My sister had a better encounter but that is her story.
19960615	19970718	 Linesville, PA	 light	1 hr	Summary : witnessed flashes of light like explosions along the West,East, and SouthWestern horizonsI, Steven, was camping out on top of a hill near a green water tank/well ,just outside of Linesville,Pa in Pine Township, myself , Mark, Micheal, Keith, Ryan, Regis, and thier sister Monique, were playing it tag, well it started to get late so Monique went to lay down , and myself and the others basically just hung around talking .Suddenly we noticed a flash of light coming from the sky behind us in the east , our backs were facing towards Linesville , when we turned around it appeared to be heat lighting so we shrugged it off . Well about a half hour went by and I saw a sight that reminded me of a A-Bomb explosion in space, just above the SouthWestern horizon. &quot;Look at that did you see that?&quot; I said to my friends , some of them said yes , the others said that they caught a glimpse of something .Well thinking that was it for the strangeness that the night would bring we started playing tag again , well me and Mark were on the western side of the green tank when Regis yelled for us to look * well we looked towards his voice , he was on the eastern side of the tank along with everyone else except me and Mark , we looked up and the heat lightning like light had returned in the eastern sky ,we ran as fast as we could to the others as the light continued to flash , as the light flashed in the eastern sky, we looked to the west and saw another explosive time of light like a A-Bomb, as the night continued the events diminished and we went to sleep scared  about what was going on but before went went to sleep all we could talk about was the events that had occured . I realize that there&apos;s not much to work with as far a solid proof but i think its important enough event to report to you anyway even after a year , thank you.
19970721	19970721	 Nun&apos;s Island (Canada), PQ	 formation	8 seconds	Summary : Formation of silent, pale round objects on top of cloud ceiling ( about 15% cloud cover).I can&apos;t believe what I saw! I am still bewildered. I was at a friend&apos;s place discussing a future project. About 10:20 PM I left the building to go back home. I got out of the side door and walked across the parking lot. The sky tonight is fairly clear, except a few clouds here and there. Suddenly on top of the clouds I saw what I first thought a cloud moving faily quick towards the North. As it passed the small group of clouds it was actually a group of five circles in some V formation, with 4 of the cricles on the right side, and one on the left. They were, and I noticed, evenly spaced. The color was some sort of light gray, paler than the clouds. I look down then up and it was still there, moving at a nonchalant speed direction North. Wow! Whatever it was it faded in the sky as it moved away (not because it disappeared, but because of the distance). I ran back to  my friend Mike&apos;s place and tried to reach him but the intercom was dead (usual). I ran under is porch and yell! ed his name. He and his girlfriend ran down to see what was happening. After telling them and looking for a while (it had been gone for a few minutes by then) I ran upstairs and drew what I saw on an envelop ( 4 frames ). Don&apos;t take me wrong, I am not a hardcore disbeliever, but I tend to believe that everything can be explained (especially UFO cases) but this one is a little tougher. It was not a reflection on the clouds, it was on top of them (they were really sparse too). It was not an airplane, it was too high. I called places to find out what the ceiling was but I could not find a place that would report that. I got on the web trying to find something and I got here by curiosity. It was not balloons, it travelled to fast (when I say it, I mean the formation). The formation was going at the same speed throughout the experience. I don&apos;t know what it was! I need to find out what the cloud ceiling was tonight a top Montreal so I can make approximations as to the size of the circles. Also was there a radar somewhere that could have recorded this? I&apos;m sending this then going back outside.

19970704	19970708	 Belleville (3.5 SW of Scott AFB), IL	 light	seconds	Summary : Royal Blue light moving very fast, east to west almost directly overhead. Small teardrop shape.While watching 4th of July fireworks display (from Belleville Area College), the royal blue light was observed directly overhead on an east to west heading (parallel to IL Route 161).  Sighting was about 3.5 mile SW of Scott AFB IL.  Object was moving very fast and had no real shpe that could be noted, if anything teardrop with a white sparkling contrail.  The object was NOT in the area or vacinity of any fireworks being displayed and was potentially observed by thousands of individuals watching the fireworks.  I offer the number of observers as 2+ as a neighbor and I were talking as we both saw the other than fireworks light.

19971107	19971112	 Austin, TX		19:00	The UFO I had Reported has turned out to be an IFO to my relief.  It was the Iridium satellite flash. We picked up the satellite naked-eye just northeast of Jupiter, when it flared to at least-4, maybe brighter.
0000	19971005	 Rohnert Park, CA	 rectangle	1 minute	Summary : Saw black monolith type objectI was outside in my driveway smoking a cigarette, I looked up at the  stars and there was this very large black rectangle silently moving above me. There  were no lights and it made absolutely no noise. It  seemed to be very low, 20 to 40 feet above. I watched it go south until it was not in my sight. I am the kind of person who would be the first to call others over to look at some interesting thing, but I never did. In fact, I forgot about it until recently, which is weird because normally something that unusual I would recall.
19970508	19970508	 Citrus Heights (a suburb of Sacramento), CA	 other	2 min (approx)	Summary : Object of an unknown type cruising at a low rate of speed over the area of Citrus HeightsWhile on my newspaper delivery route, I observed an object which I initially believed to be an aircraft decending to land. It then occured to me that it was in the wrong area to be either leaving or arriving at the airport. I then noticed that the lights which I had though were the wing tip lights, (which as you know blink red and green) were only white and that they were blinking in a circular pattern. There appeared to be a red light on the underside of the object which did not blink. The white lights were very bright and continued flashing the entire time that the object was visible to me. The object appeared to be cruising very slowly approximately 1 to 2 miles away. I could not hear any sounds coming from the object even though it is very quiet at that time of morning.The object appeared to be circular in shape but overall was similar to the shape of a derby hat with a domed section on top. from my vantage point I would estimate the size to be approximately 25 feet in diameter. As ti travelled I eventually lost sight of it as trees in the area blocked my view. I am a 45 year old male, I wear glasses and the other observer was my son who is a 15 year old male, he does not wear glasses. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes.
19950327	19971201	 Loveland/Estes Park (between), CO	 light	45 min	Summary : It looked like a star that was moving across the night sky.  But it stopped and changed direction again and again.  It changed color and became up to 5 separate lights always moving closer to us.  Near the end we could see spotlights from the craft(s).  It disapeared straight up so fast it could not have been man made.We were all camping, and sober.  It was green at first and when it was clear it was not a star or satalite it changed into up to 5 lights.  They were all changing colors sometimes when forming shapes.  Squares with the bottm red and top green.  Then a diamond all blue then white.  We watched for 25 min. then our vision was blocked by a rock face.  We all discussed what we saw and decided if we climbed on top of this rock and we were able to see it again it was certainly not our imaginations.  we viewed it again from on top of this rock face for 20 min more.  We could now see spot lights coming from it- them...  It continued to change the shapes it was forming and color of the lights that were visable. The spotlights were changing color too.  It went back to a single light, brighter than it was befoe.  Then it changed in to 3 then 5 then 9 lights forming a hoop of white lights only.  No other colors just white.  It accelerated to the west and upward so fast that the hoop i! mprint of light was visable for atleast a full second after it was gone.  If it was man made I would like to meet the men who built it-them.  We were all pretty quiet for the last min or so just watching, but when it flashed away that fast all of us screamed at the same time in aknowledgemnet.  Witnesses I am sure ((Name deleted)) of Ft. Collins will not mind me giving his name and #  (970) # deleted)).  My name is ((Name &amp; # deleted)).  The other 2 witnesses stopped telling people what we saw, to stop the constant ridicule and attention.  ((Name deleted))  of Fort Collins and ((Deleted)) of Loveland.   We were near Carter Lake in Loveland, Co.
19960531	19970509	 Chinquipin (Matagorda county, 10 miles southeast of se, TX	 light	5 minutes	Summary : A single point of light resembling a satallitebut moving very fast and making instant sharp turnsunlike any known object can.Me and my brother were sitting on the dock at our bay house fishing. My brothers attention was drawn away bywhat he believed to be a shooting star.He pointed at it but i was unable to locate it due to partial cloud cover, and its dimmness. He lost sight of it in the clouds, but regained sightof it comming out from the other side of the cloud. At that point he noted that the object made a course change of about 20 degrees and continuedout of sight over the horizon. The object followed an almost perfect north to south course untill the change which was slightly more to the east.I was unable to see this object as it was moving so fast it was gone in less than 10 seconds. There was no &apos;tail&apos; on the object, nor was theremore than one single point of light. its dimmness was equivilent to that of a satellite reflecting the sun in the evening and reflecting the suns light.After he settled down, and finished explaining his idea about it being a UFO, we went back to fishing, both of us now watching the sky.  Less than5 minutes later, the object reappeared, again from the north. this time I was the one who spotted it first and pointed it out to my brother. He confirmedthat it was the same object he viewed previously. With both of us watching, the object started a series of right angle turns that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It made about 6 or 7 course changes overhead and continued towards the south like origionally, and disappeared behind our bay house. It AGAIN reappeared out fromthe side of the bay house low on the horizon to the south over the gulf of mexico. at this point it was moving horizonally and was moving extremely fast the entire way.By extremely fast I mean like a shooting star moves fast. We both watched it move horizontally about 30-40 degrees across the horizon, then it turned again, in a very sharpzero curve turn to a northerly direction. It proceeded across the sky making one final course change of about 10-20 degrees comming to an almost perfect north direction andproceeded out of sight into the clouds along the north horizon.I need to note here that it is uncanny how familiar it is to the looks of a satellite in orbit. We both had the perception that the object was VERY far away. With the exceptionof a few low clouds, it was VERY dark and MANY stars were visible. I think city lights (like from Houston 60 miles away) would easily have drowned out the light.its my personal view that the object was not in our atmosphere.Also, i emphasize that every single turn it made had no &apos;curves&apos; in them. If you drew a right angle, thats the path it was following.I would have been more skepticle of what we saw, but increadibly, there was a report the following monday (we saw it on the first saturday morning following memorial day)in the Houston Chronicle (June 2nd i believe) reporting that there were 16 reported sightings of a UFO from Galveston Island. This island is approx. 80-100 miles WNW of ourlocation.

19970922	19971112	 St. Louis, MO	 other	approx 1 hr	Summary : We had just moved into our new home and could not sleep.  At approx. 3:00 a.m. I noticed a glowing object in the eastern sky at about horizon level.  It was far enough away that when it moved around, the telephone and electrical wires were hiding it.  My husband asked me if I saw it and I told him yes.  We did not have the camcorder or binoculars unpacked, but we did have the site from his telescope.  You could see that the thing was changing colors from white to blue to green.  We live very close to an airport (practically at the end of the runway) and noted that there was no airplane activity.  This is very unusual for Lambert Field.  The next night at about the same time my husband and a friend saw the same light, but this time there were approx 3 objects doing the same thing as the night before.  They were convinved thath what they saw that night was a UFO.  My husband said they were much more active thath night than the night before when we saw it together.  I do not be! lieve it was a star and we have discussed if it was possible to be some type of new aircraft that McDonnell/Boeing could be testing.  We heard no noise or saw any other activity.
19940407	19970703	 Brookfield, CT	 light	00:00:30	Summary : Large, bright object crested over NW horizon moving very fast, my friend and I both saw the object, and another of my friends reported sightin the same object about 2 min. later coming from the same direction.One large, luminous sphere apeared over the Northwest horizon directly in front of my friend and I, the diameter of the light itself would have easily covered the moon.The light was traveling over 100 MPH, at an altitude of only about 1000 feet yet did not make any sound.  If the object were a helicopter or an airplane, we would have easily heard it.  The light was similar in size and shape to the objects that appeared over Phoenix 2 weeks ago.  At the time, we were both students In Brookfield.  I was 10 years old, and my friend was 11 years old.  We had gone outside to &quot;look for&quot; UFOs, but we were not prepared for what we saw that night.  I am only submitting this information after the occurrance of a similar sighting over Phoenix, AZ.  Thank you.
19800812	19971022	 Honolulu, HI	 rectangle	5 min	Summary : Saw large bus like vehicleOne night I was drunk and ((deleted)) out in the yard looking down into the valley of Aina Haina, Honolulu Hawaii. I looked down toward the busy highway and saw this bus like thing above the highway. I squinted and looked again. It was still there. In this valley, there are many dogs but they were not making a peep for hours. A few seconds later the valley erupted with many dogs going crazy all at once. I told my girlfriend Ester to come out and look. I said &quot;do you see that thing down there?&quot; She said yes, what is that? I said I don&apos;t know. It looked like a big bus with lights moving slowly out of our view above the highway. Was I drunk or what? I know all about planes, etc. but was I seeing things or what? I still think about it every once and a while, but I quit drinking years ago--Aloha!

I work the early morning shift and at this time of year the sun hasn&apos;t risen yet.  I have been watching the sky a lot lately due to some very strange looking airplane lights, we have had a great deal of air activity lately.  Anyway, was watching a regular plane flying in the North and then I turned around to take the unleaded gas reading when I looked up and saw an auburn red dot floating across the sky.  At first I thought it was a falling star, because there was no sound, but then it darted to the left, not slightly it was a very fast long movement, and then it just disappeared.  It was very graceful and strange to stay the least.  My descriptions is a single working Mom.  I don&apos;t know if this is something or not, but I hope it helps.
19970202	19970401	 Thackery, OH	 unknown	1and 1/2 hours	Objects that move much more quickly than airplanes.  They moved strait up and down even below tree tops.  They would stay still for many minutes and then dart quickly away.  They seemed to land in fields around us. Me and my father saw about 25 of these objects on the way home.  I am 15 and my father is 42 and works as a manager for GTE.
19971024	19971025	 Blountville, TN	 circle	3 minutes	Summary : Brightly lit circular object (circular light pattern) hovering 1 1/2 minutes and suddenly darting away faster than conventional aircraft. Estimated distance from witnesses 1-2 miles.At about  0630 Friday morning 24 Oct 1997 ((Two names deleted)) observed a circular object seeming to spin with lights in excess of 20 rpm. The first impression was that of a streetlight atop a nearby hill. After about  1 1/2 minutes stationary, the object suddenly darted off at a slightly ascending angle emitting a  noise similar to a jet aircraft. Observed flight-in-motion time approximately 4-5 seconds before disappearing behind a stand of trees. The color of the lights was very bright pale yellow.
19971114	19971116	 North Camano Island - Buena Vista  area- above Utsalady Bay, WA	 formation	20-60 seconds	Summary : Double line of bright, ember hot colored lights. From W. to E. Most amazing was the dark grey colored object in the wake of these. Looked like zepplin, going as fast as the lights. Blinked out one by one including the grey object.  Object was illuminated by these lights only - no internal or external lights of it&quot;s own. No sound or only faint hum.  Were we the only ones who saw this special object? Still having a hard time believing this part of what I clearly saw.The lights were numbered in the dozens, bright hot, ember or candle glow colored.  ran in a fast parrallel line from the West toward the East.  We are high above the water of Utsalady and Skagit Bays with a clear, unobstructed view across Skagit Bay and northward toward Anacortes. Appeared to be closer then is being reported.  If these were high in the atmosphere, then the grey object that was moving with these lights had to be hugh.  Because it was close enough to be illuminated by these lights.

19970316	19970516	 Mountain View, CA	 sphere	2 minutes	Summary : While travelling eastbound on Moffet Blvd at 6:48p.m. I observed what I first thought to be a plane.  The object was spherical in shape and appeared to be of metallic substance and reflectivity.I expected that this was an airplane and watched for it to turn, however after observing it for about one minute, I came to the conclusion that it was not going to turn.  It simply seemed to hover just east of Moffet fieldat an altitude of approximately 4-5000 feet.  After about 1 more minute, the object simply disappeared.While driving eastbound on Moffet Blvd from Mountain View towards Moffet field at 6:48p.m., I observed what I first thought to be an airplane.  The object was spherical in shape and appeared to be of metallic substance and reflectivity.I expected that this was an airplane and watched for it to turn, however after observing it for about one minute, I came to the conclusion that it was not going to turn.  It simply seemed to hover just east of Moffet fieldat an altitude of approximately 4-5000 feet.  After about 1 more minute, the object simply disappeared.  I looked around for any airplanes or other objects in the sky and found none.  The sky was blue, clear, and visibility of several miles.I then turned the radio to the news channel to listen for any news of anyone else observing such an article but heard nothing.It seemed appropriate to report this sighting in case anyone else happens to report a similar sighting.I would be happy to answer any further questions by email or phone.

It appeared in the police blotter in the shaw spirit (base paper). I was watching TV when I saw a bright light come through my window. I looked out to see who was shining it in my house when i noticed a hovering object circular in shape approximately 75 yards away. I immediately went to wake my wife so she could also see it. Returning to the window I noted that the object was beginning to lift higher. returning to my bedroom i again tried to wake her. this time she came in but it had already climbed high enough that only if you knew what you were looking for could you see it. I didn&apos;t say anything more about it till i saw it in the base paper. then i told my wife the details. It made no sound, and the light it gave off made no shadow. It climbed at a rate no jet I&apos;ve seen can make. 2 weeks after this event my neighbors were over for dinner, they breached the subject by saying &quot;your gonna think we&apos;re crazy. But we saw a UFO in your yard just 2 weeks ago.&quot;. Needless to say we exchanged our views of that night and they matched exactly. My background is a avionics Technician for the ((Deleted)).

Which brings up another weird event. my 2nd day home from the hospital, i had a most troubling dream that i was being dragged from bed and dragged through some tall grass toward a bright light. I awoke that morning and woke the wife to go make breakfast, as i sat up she asked what was on my back. Then she brushed off a handfull of grass seed... I told her about that nights dream. and we both agreed it was weird. She says she remembers waking that night and i wasn&apos;t in bed, she thought i was on the computer so gave no thought to it. when we entered our front room, my brother 14 years old, was sleeping on the couch. he asked where we went last night. We said no where, why? He said he heard the door open and close once, like someone had left but never heard anyone return.

19970331	19970422	 Juneau, AK	 light	approx  2hrs	Summary : A friend and I saw a strange low altitude bright object flashing orange and green rotating colors on Easter night in Juneau,Alaska. When seen through my telescope (wewere looking at the comet and the planets),it had this strange light and dark light,pattern or field around and above it, likelight defraction patterns. No other starswere as low or had that effect. I could notsee colors with telescope. Only by naked eyeobservations.I was visting a friend and she and I werelooking at the comet on Easter night andshe said hey, look at that satellite! I wasfacing north and I focused my Meade telescopeon it. It was flashing orange and green in arotating fashion...I then looked at itthrough my scope and to my surprise I couldntdetect the colors!Instead it had this really weird lightfield...of dark and bright lines above andaround it...like a light defraction pattern.The object was really bright white with thosestrange lines going around it in a strangestriped pattern. The colors could not bedetected with the scope! I then thought itwas my lens so I focused on a bright star andthe patterns were not present on anything else!When I looked again with just my eyes I sawthe flashing rotating orange and green lightsbut when I used the scope, all I saw was thestrange dark and light patterns. It was lowin the sky, and stationary. I was facingnorth and it was to my right. I looked at itoff and on for about 2 hrs. while checkingout the comet and mars.I went home, I live a block away, and when Igot to my house and looked up again to find it,it was not there--to my right! I was stillfacing north. I looked to my left and thereit was! It was so close(low)that a one blockdrive was enough to move it over. So it meansit was positioned in between my friends houseand mine! I dont think high altitudegeosynchronistic satellites would be lowenough to cause that much of a difference ifI moved only a block away! Plus later, after2 days of clouds, it was no where to be seen!Ive never seen anything out of the ordinarybefore. I know what venus and mars and theother planets look like through my scope, soI&apos;m sure it wasnt a planet!My friend saw the colored lights, cause shepointed it out to me, but she went intoher house while I stayed outside and lookedat the sky and the &quot;object&quot;. It was too coldfor her! I didnt really think too much aboutthe strange erie lights until I got home andrealized that the object was WAY TOO LOW,cause it moved to my left, to be a satellitelike my friend first thought it was.

19971009	19971012	 Camarillo, CA	 circle	2 minutes	Summary : all three of us were friends. My friend,((Name deleted))f, saw it first. He said &quot;What&apos;s that shiny thing in the sky?&quot; I said, &quot;Where? I don&apos;t see it.&quot; then I found it, and pointed it out to mmy other friend. Then, my friends went along their own ways, and I was looking at it still, I lost sight of it at times, but I always fouind it. When it was above me, I saw that the bottom was circular, with three &quot;Lights&quot; or something making a triangle.  Before that, I saw that it was &quot;flashing&quot; too.My friend, ((Name deleted)) saw it first. He was saying to me, &quot;look at that shiny thing in the sky.&quot; And I looked, and I saw nothing, so I said, &quot;I can&apos;t see it.&quot; Then I found it, and I was staring at it for a good minute there.It was moving around in a way I don&apos;t think anything on earth can do. And then, I pointed it out to my other friend, Amanda, and she saw it too. We were running the mile, because it was PE, and so ((Two names deleted)) jogged off. But I was still looking at the object. the side of the object was weird, i can&apos;t really describe it. When the object was above me, I could see the bottom was circular, and there were three &quot;lights&quot; forming a triangle. I had to at least jog for the mile, so I looked away for a moment and started to jog. When I looked back, It wasn&apos;t there. My friends are very nice ant trustworthy, I don&apos;t think they did something, obvious there, because we were in school!
19960501	19971119	 Why, AZ	 light	30 min	Summary : Approx. 10-15 clusters of boomerang shaped lightsEach boomerang cluster had about 8-10 lights, and all ten or so units moved in unisom across the night sky.  There speed was about the same as one of our aircrafts.  We used binoculars. but could not tell if each unit of V-shaped lights were connected or separate.  Since the whole array covered a huge area of sky, we think each v- shaped unit was independent.  We observed this strange sight for approx. 30 minutes
19971028	19971028	 Sacramento, CA	 light	5 mintues	Summary : I was driving when i saw lights flashing on and off. The lights were very fast, faster than a plain. When the object flew over my head there was no sound at all. There lights would flash all different directions and then there would be two lights that would flash at the same time.I was driving down Amercian River Drive when i saw two lights flash. Then there was one flash afther the other all over. The objsct moved all differnet ways. After the lights would flash all over there would be two lights flash at the same time. I could not make an outline of the object but the lights were flashing to fast for it to be a plaine. The object did not make any nosie when it flew over, but it moved all over the sky every rapidly. I have never seen anything like it.

I yelled for my wife,but it was too late.
19970626	19970627	 Pretoria (South Africa),	 light	10-15 sec	Summary : Bright, arc-white light observed moving fromWSW to ENE at high speed. Altitude roughly500 metres (1500 feet). Distance at start ofsighting roughly 5 KM (8 mi.), distance atend of sighting roughly 8 KM (12 mi.)Light seemed to have tinges of colour at certain points in sighting: pink, red, orange. Speed comparable with Mirage F1 CZ at Mach 1+.I stepped out of my back door, and as is myhabit, I scanned the range of hills roughly1 KM north of my house. I observed thislight moving in the direction indicated (WNWto ENE), and when first observed, the objectappeared just above the hills to the West,altitude about 500 metres. Object moveddiagonally across my line of sight until Ilost it behind the hills directly North ofmy position. From what I can therefore extra-polate, it moved roughly 9 KMs in 10-15seconds. That&apos;s about between 2100 and 3200KM per hour (1300 mph - 2000 mph). No soundwhatsoever, but at Mach speeds. Should havecaused a sonic boom, at that altitude.Light was extremely bright, white: almost likean arc-light. No strobes or pulsation, justthe slight colour change that could have beendue to haze or pollution (it&apos;s winter here, and at 18:30it&apos;s just gone fully dark).My background: 35 year old male.Current occupation:((three lines of credentials deleted)). Live in Pretoria, home of 2 AFB&apos;s (Waterkloof &amp; Zwartkops).
19971114	19971117	 Snohomish, WA	 formation	10 seconds	Summary : Large object seen traveling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300-500 feet above the ground and 250 to 300 yards from observer.  Object was rectangular, and was about the size of a football field.  Appeared to be translucent with reddish/orange lights of different intensity surrounding the perimeter, however, the dark superstructure could be seen, outlined by the lights.  4 observers saw the object, 2 of which pursued in a car but could never regain sight.  3 observers later made schetches of the object without the others input.  All were strikenly similar.UFO sighting November 14th, 1997.  XXXXX 86th St. S.E. Snohomish,  Wa. 98290. 9:10 P.M. My wife ((deleted)) was in the hot tub outside at the time and my four sons and myself were inside the house.  My wife appeared at the front door very excited/frantic calling for us to come outside.  When I got outside she pointed to the northeast and sad in a load voice &quot;Whats that!!&quot;  I didn&apos;t answer her at the time because I was in awe of what I was seeing.  My 12 year old son ((Name deleted)) and my 16 year old son ((Name deleted)) had also come outside with me and were witness to this event as well.  My wife was viewing this object for about 1 to 2 minutes before she summond me.  During this time the object looked very different.  She described it a appearing as a white ball with flames or trails of sparks shouting out behind it.  When I first saw it the object was travelling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300 to 500 feet above the ground.  The object was large (about the size of a football field) and appeared to be translucent.  Weather at the time was extremely clear with the tempe! rature between 35-40F.  Multiple lights surrounded the perimeter (reddish/orange) and varied in intensity.  The dark outline of the superstructure could be seen outlined by the lights.  Object was 200-250 yards from our position of observation.  No sound eminated from the object and there was no other noise (cars, planes, stereos, etc.) at the time.  It was very quiet.  Object was pursued in a vehicle but sighting was not regained.  Various news reports speculated that the sighting was due to Leonid Meteor shower or a Russion spacecraft reentering earths atmosphere.  Meteors do not fly subsonically in formation horizontally for 10 seconds.  It was not that.  While there was a Russian spacecraft that did reenter the earths atmosphere and was seen by many people on the west coast at about this time, the reckage supposedly ended up in the Pacific ocean.  The object we saw was traveling northeast,  had a very clear symmetry/structure and was close enough to us for us to  want to p! ursue it.  I have read many books on astronomy and the UFO phenomenon and have worked at The ((Name deleted)) Company for 18 years as a business analyst.  This sighting did not have anything to do with the Leonid meteor shower, Russian space junk or planes flying in formation!
19971001	19971007	 Lakeland, FL	 light	1 minute	Summary : 3 oval shaped reddish-orange lights flew over my house, heading directly south. The lights formed a perfect triangle, but flying severely crabbed to direction. Est elevation, 5,000&apos;. est size 50-60&apos; across. speed apx 150kmh. No sound. Very clear night. Triangular area between lights vibrated like rippling water. Very noticeable. Object flew south apx 45 seconds, then turned southeast. All 3 lights remained visible at all times till all out of sight.The 3 oval lights were not AC lights and the angle the object(s) were flying towards was crabbed. When the object(s) were directly overhead, the very pronounced vibrations or rippling effect taking place between the lights (in the triangular shape) was very pronounced. Also, the object(s) flew south and through the Lakeland Airport traffic pattern -restricted fly space.
19951007	19970620	 Jacksonville (in Mandarin), FL	 triangle	3 min	Summary : Triangualar shaped object hovering in place.VERY close to the road,and this was a busy highway with people in front and behind.At night.Slow rotation.It was stelth black in shape of a triangle hovering extremly close to the highway to theleft of us.It was right above some trees and a street light turning slowly clockwise.A red light was at each corner and a large white light was in the center.There were other lights smaller and scattered.It was definately an equalateral triangle.For some reason when we were driving by I noticed it and pointed it out to the others and they saw it but would not admit it was unusual.I kept saying it was something not ever seen around here .Strangely everyone in the car began to refuse to look at it as if it were not there,but I knew it was,and started getting agitated with me and telling me to hush.When I had first pointed it out to my friend he got really frightened or excited and tried with me to show the people in the front but then he got all quiet.When I asked why he had stoped he just told me it must be something else like a street light.I have perfect 20 20 vision and that thing was only as far away as a hundred feet.Im also an artist and have a photographic memory,i know !i saw something.The people in the car with me seemed to be in denial the whole time.Now when I mention it to them they dont even remember what happened,they look at me like Im nuts.I even triedto talk to them the next day after it happened and they had no idea or memory.I was 15 then and have no history of hallucinations.This DID happen.P.S. I can give a vivid drawing but I dont know how to send it,would you contact me please?

19910201	19970630	 Quartzite (20 miles east of), AZ	 light		Summary : Large object with a row of white lights on one side and row of red lights on other (about six each) hovering over rest stop in Arizona, February 1991.I read with interest your news releases about the sightings in Arizona in March 1997.  My husband and I were traveling to Tucson in February 1991 on a very dark night.  At about 10:00 I noticed a row of lights in the distance.  I thought there must have been a house on a hill with all its lights on.  It looked like it was about a mile or so away.  As we approached it appeared that the brightness of the lights suddenly increased, as if the &quot;house&quot; had tilted.  We approached a rest stop, about 20 or 25 miles east of Quartzite, Arizona, where the lights were hovering.  There were about six white lights in a row.  Since it was so dark I thought they were some high antennas over the rest stop.  I could see no object, only the lights.  We had never been there before and were not familiar with the area.  There were also two smaller red lights in the area that seemed to be slowly moving.  Since our car was traveling at about 65 miles per hour, I thought they were also antennas, but !thought it was odd that they seemed to be moving.  As we passed the white lights, I said to my husband, who was driving, &quot;There are some strange lights up there.&quot;  He only had an opportunity to glance up and see the white lights, but since they were quite high in the sky, perhaps 100 feet, he only saw them momentarily. As we passed, I looked back, and there were the same number of red lights on the other side, which were blinking somewhat randomly, not in any pattern.  We continued on to Tucson, and I asked someone who was familiar with that road if they ever saw any odd lights at that rest stop, and he said he thought he had, so I dismissed them as antennas.  On the way home, we took at good look at that rest stop during the day, and there were no high antennas and no hills or mountains nearby.  We have been on that road several times since then, and once we took a frontage road near that rest stop and noticed there was a power plant about 1/4 mile from there that could not b!e seen from the highway.  Last February my husband and I again traveled to Tucson at night and stopped at that rest stop to get a few hours sleep.  The only lights we saw were some red ones on a low post that were more or less vertical, and definitely much closer to the ground than the ones we had witnessed that night.  We have mentioned the sighting to a few people but never have officially reported it.
19940601	19970810	 Christchurch (New Zealand),	 sphere	5.00 min	Summary : Driving around Witch Hill area of Banks Penninsula, passed strange. There were 3 lights, not completely certain of their colour, They were in a stationary position. There was another white light which zig zagged around the stationary lights, and this light would move from extremely bright to dim, this light merged with the stationary lights, then a white flourecent looking ball appeared and passed us, dissappearing below the horizon of the hill, none of the lights made any sound, I ran to get a closer look at the lights, the other two were insistant that we get back in the car and drive around the Penninsula to get a closer look, we never sighted the lights again. This was all close proximity, approx 100-200 m.I really wish we had a video camera with us that night!!!
19970419	19970422	 Suisun (North S.F.

Noneof the witnesses talked witheachother so no information wasexchanged.  Tom and Mary calledthe local paper, the DailyRepublic and a small articlewas written.No other witnesses have beenfound yet, however, CharlieGoodyear whom wrote the articlefor D.R. stated that he hadtalked to a Capt. Robert Kirbyat Travis. In his article hestates, &quot;Officials at TravisAir Force Base did get onephone call around 10:30 p.m.Saturday from an unidentifiedwoman reporting a mysteriouslight in the sky.  But airtraffic controllers and basepersonnel noticed nothingunusual, Capt. Robert Kirbysaid.&quot;  When I interviewed Tomhe stated, &quot;They couldn&apos;t havemissed it if they were evenlooking out the window!  Theywould have needed sunglasses!&quot;Charlie Goodyear checked withlocal police and sheriff&apos;sdept. and found there were noreportings of the anamoly. Ichecked with the local firemarshall whom is in charge of,and lives in, the range landswhere the incident occured.  Hestated he was not aware of theoccurance or anyone reportingit, but would call me if heheard anything.According to the witness&apos;sdescriptions, this light didnot move across the sky and didnot seem to originate from aphysical object, but simplyexisted as its own source withno density. No noise could beheard and it did not travel ormove from its active location.It would however, shift andtransform from being round(size of dime), then enlargingto round (silver dollar), thenwould stretch out &quot;like gum&quot; inlength (dollar bill), thenseparating into two. Then itwould come back together like around dime and would then fadeout to size of a pinpoint, likea TV tuner turned off. Then itwould come back repeating theprocess. Witnesses stated thisprocess repeated about 6 times.One time upon separation, thetwo lights  moved diagonally toeach other, like a &quot;chevron&quot;with 2 strips, shimmering likea reflection on water.Eventually when fadeing itnever came back. While cloudswere scattered through the skysthe area where the lights wereshowing contained none. Tomstated he frequents through thearea quite often and is awareof regular air traffic due tothe AFB, however during thislight show no air traffic wasnoticed what so ever.The witnesses were interviewedtogether by phone.  Tom is 52,and is a grocer&apos;s clerk.  Maryis 50 and is a purchaser for anintercom company.  Both areinterested in spiritual/psychictype information, but do notkeep up with latest gossip orhappenings in that regard.Mary stated she did not read orwatch the news reports, andthat as she did not even knowabout the comet, until sheasked Tom one night what shewas seeing in the sky. Bothhave had a light interest inUFO&apos;s but again do not keep upwith latest gossip etc...Together through the interview,they seemed to mutually agreeupon their story, as theyshared enthusiasm andexcitement about it.  Neitherwould speculate as to what itwas they saw, except that theyboth &apos;felt&apos; it was not aterrestial source orphenomenon. Both did not feelfrightened by the expierienceand talked about it as apositive expierience. Therewere no physical effectsreported.  Witnesses reportedaprox. 5 vehicles passed onHighway 12 during theirstationary 5 miniute viewing.They found it strange that thevehicles passed as withoutnotice of the event. As ifobservation was limited only tothose who were there initially.The area in which this occuredis a rural area, consisting ofplains type terrain, coveringover 2000 sq miles.  Populationwithin the sighting area issparse, probably 1 ranch forevery 2 sq miles. Communitiesclose enough to have possiblywitnessed the light show wereBirdslanding, Rio Vista, Dixon,and possibly eastern Fairfieldand Suisun.  All aresurrounding the proximitywithin 15 miles.  Birdslandingis the closest within 5 miles.Attempts were made to locateaddtional witnesses with nosuccess. Contact was madeeither in person or by leavinga note, with ranches in theimmediate vicinity of thesighting location.Birdslanding, a rural communityof ranches, is directly acrossHighway 12,  may containwitnesses.  Many events of thisnature, in the past, have beenreported in the Birdslandingarea.  I made contact with thepostmaster for this area andgave her cards with a requestfor contact if she heardanything.  She readily agreed.I went out to view the site andcheck for any natural sourceswhich may explain this event. Idid so on 4/21 at 23:00 to gainperspective with a similarnight environment. It wasobserved that radio towersexisted aprox. 15 miles NE ofthe sighting area. Thesetransmission towers are highand thin.  2 of them had lightswhich were greenish and wouldflash on and off.  Both towerswere aprox. 3 miles apart andwould alternatly do this in aregular sequence.  Whileconsidering this as a possiblesource it was eliminated whilereinacting their viewpoint.The towers were to far off inan easterly direction and theirproximity to the horizon couldnever have contributed to thesize and altitude of the event.Additionaly the descriptionwhich was given did not matchthe constant sequence in whichthese towers flashed.Daytime observation of the areawas also made. No otherpotential sources were noted.Witnesses will provide markerdrawings in a followupinterview in two weeks.  Thisalong with any further datagathered will be forwarded atthat time.
19971121	19971208	 North Kingstown, RI	 triangle	10sec or less	Summary : While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it&apos;s lights on heading in an easternly dirtection to Green Airport.  We were driving on route 1 heading north onto route 4 Just as we came to a location on rt.4 near a combination miniture golf/batters cages/golf hitting range that is when we noticed the airplaine w/ it&apos;s lights on.  In this same are there are no tall trees and the area has a considerable panoramic view.  The air plaine was a couple hundred feet in the air, and I had a view of about  100 to 120 degrees.  A friend of mine has informed that jet airliners go a maximum speed of about 200-250 mph.  I would assume that the airplane was going less than 200 mph if it was heading for a landing at green.  No sooner than I had seen this plane I then saw another plane above the 1st,  it was 2 time the hight of the 1st it too had its lights on and both had a triangular look to then. BUT as I watched both airplane&apos;s the 2nd passed the 1st as if it was standing still.  W/ in  5 seconds it was compleatly out of my sight as it to headed easterly direction. I would estimate that the other plane?!?!? was going about 10 time the speed of the 1st.  Even my youg daughter mentioned &quot;look at that dad&quot;I have a back ground in science/natural history.  I have seen the jets at the airshows in the summer at Quonsett base at the old sea-bees base.  The only time I have ever seen them disappeare that fast, they were close to the  ground.  I would estimate that both objects were about 1000 feet to 1/2 a mile away. Since it was dusk and dark I could not see  much except that both had a grey outline and both had their lights on.  dividing my windsheld up into 10 units by the time the 1st airplaine went one unite the second had disappeared.  I would basicly estimate that the 2nd object/plane was going 10 times the speed of the 1st. So if the 1st plane was going about 180 to 200 mph then the 2nd&quot;plane/object&quot; was going about  1800 to 2000 mph or more.  I have never seen a &quot;plane&quot; dissapear from my field of view like that in my life.  I have never seen a ufo in my life but because of the speed that this &quot;plane&quot;  was  going and that it dissapeared out of my viewing area w/in 5 + seconds I thought I should report this. I do not want to leave my name because I have heard about another person who has witnessed triangular and cigar shaped ufo&apos;s here in RI and that this same person who has recorded these ufo&apos;s, has since reported them on line.  I was also told that since this person reported these sightings several months later but use his own computer.  Later I was told that the ufo reporter was literally  visited by people in a white lincoln and the &apos;visitors&apos; were taking pictures of this persons house.  These visitors stoped the picture taking only after having their picture taken by the person who made the ufo reporting.  I was also told that the visitors inthe white lincoln had no plates on it at all, because they had watched it arrive and leave.  In fact on its way in twords this persons house, a cop had stoped the white lincoln and then left the lincoln alone. Depending who these people  in the white lincoln are be it &quot;men in black&quot; or &quot;government military personell&quot; I for one do not want my life subject to what ever hell these people put  ufo reporters through. All my daughter knows of ufo&apos;s is what she saw in the men in black video, I don&apos;t want her or myself subjected to anysort of &quot;interogation terror tactics&quot;.  I asked her about the &quot;fast plane &quot; we saw the previous week and she didn&apos;t remember the sighting that we had made at all. Anon. in RI
19961205	19970617	 Toronto (Canada), ON		1-1.5 min	Summary : It was a fast flying object, which had about three extremely strong lights.  It was flying very high, and I noticed no noise.  It appeared to be on fire, for there was a flame coming out of the rear of the vehicle. I was waching TV and then suddenly every chanell became blurry.  I turned off the TV and went to listen to the radio but that didn&apos;t work either. I looked outside and there it was.
19970704	19970707	 St. Charles, MO	 light	few seconds	Summary : Observed a blue-green light crossing the skyfrom Northeast to Southwest (paralleling theMissouri River).While waiting for the 4th of July fireworks tostart, my wife and several friends were lookingup at the night sky when the &quot;light&quot; crossed thesky.  There were broken to scattered clouds atabout 2-3000 feet, and the light was visiblethrough the clouds, but obviously above them.Given the color, I assumed that some space &quot;junk&quot;had re-entered and, containing a lot of copper,was burning up on re-entry.  Based on the speedof the object, we thought it was going the speedof a meteor.  All observors are college educated:engineer, teacher, pilot, and others.  None hadbeen drinking.
19971205	19971207	 Salton Sea (Over), CA	 disk	1/2 minute	Summary : Unidentified Flying Object on commercial Flight From LAX to TUC on 12/05/97 in the PM.
19970305	19970322	 San Francisco, CA	 oval	2 minutes	Summary : 2 small (about 1 ft. long &amp; 200 ft. away at closest) dark objects circling each other then sped south,followed min. later by 2 more.Clear sky, not windy, facing west from roof of three story building during smoke break,saw two dark, slightly oblong objects (but evenly unlike a ballon that has one roundedside and one narrow side) caught my eye as they manuevered about each other about 200or more feet away.  The movements were smooth and not jerky or bobbing (like balloonswould do) then sped off to the south faster than any wind might propell them.  I waswishing I had a pair of binoculars as they grew smaller above a building to the south.When I first saw them circling each other it appeared almost as if they were linked bya tether since they moved in tandem, but then when their path became straight they seemedto be at a greater distance appart than if this were the case.  Strangely, a dark heli-copter was circling the area directly above the closest approach of the objects at the time.It performed a pretty tight loop that seemed to focus on the area and was quite low as well.I looked up at it only two or three times and didn&apos;t notice any markings.  It didn&apos;t strikeme as a traffic helicopter and was in the wrong location if it were so if they were doingtheir job.  After the sighting I pondered whether what I saw were ballons, but this possibilityjust didn&apos;t seem to fit.  I didn&apos;t notice any wind that could account for it and the windusually comes from the west off the coast.  These objects flew from north to south.  Asmentioned in the abreviated report, the first two objects were followed by two more on thesame path, but without any circling maneuvers.
19950107	19971116	 Lake Grove (Portland Metro), OR	 disk	&lt; 1 min	Summary : Round silvery disk quickly passing from W to E in a straight lineI was enjoying the weather from my second- floor apartment deck on that fine Saturday July 1, 1995 afternoon. The 2pm (PDT) sky was partly cloudy, mostly evenly scattered cumulus with a clear blue sky behind them. I am sometimes given to looking straight up into the sky in search of high-flying raptors or other soaring birds. As I looked directly overhead,I noticed something moving well above the cumulus clouds. It was a silvery object about the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length moving in an unwavering straight line from west to east. I watched as it passed behind the clouds which were moving so slowly as to appear to be completely still. I would not want to hazard a guess as to its altitude or airspeed. My first thought was that it was simply a weather balloon. (In fact, I&apos;m still leaning towards that explanation.) As I studied it I wondered if it was in fact not silver, but translucent. It had a bluish cast but was darker around a well-defined edge and had no irregularities in its shape or surface. However, a few things didn&apos;t rest well with me. I&apos;ve seen weather balloons in flight before and this wasn&apos;t like either of them. This was perfectly round and had no visible payload. The others I had seen weren&apos;t nearly so symmetrical and were visibly balloons with something suspended underneath. Also, given that this object was well above the clouds, it would have been a *very* large balloon. As far as I know, there aren&apos;t any launch sites west of Portland used for such launchings. (That may just be my ignorance in this instance; the only launch site for high- altitude balloons that I know of is near Palestine, Texas.) I found it odd that it moved so much faster than the lower clouds, though of course the possibility of the jet stream comes to mind. I was also impressed that it moved in such a straight line. It covered about 30 degrees of the sky in 4-5 seconds. It disappeared behind a solid line of clouds banked up against Mt. Hood and the Oregon Cascades to the east. I have no idea if this was a *real* UFO or not. In fact, the most remarkable aspect of this incindent may simply be that I saw an ordinary thing in a place most people wouldn&apos;t ordinarily look--straight overhead--without some other motivation. It just to be odd enought to warrant reporting to you. Had I known how to contact anyone regarding this prior, I would have. When the UFO Center was on the news with the space junk reentry story, I knew where to go. If you need more info, contact me via email. Thanks!
19970322	19970322	 Lake Geneva, WI	 light	10 min	Summary : Near moon. small light (cover with thumb) camefrom Southeast at extremly fast speed. As it approached approximate even with moon seemed to stop and hang in air. Is very high in the sky.Moved enough to indicate that it was not the chance of a star that was sighted. All other stars that are out do not show any of this movement. The sighting was in a perfectly clear portion of the sky near the moon even though there is clouds present.Moving Object (from Southeast going West) wasbright/clear. Object/Light seemed to be round however it was so high it was hard to becertain. The object moved in straight line forprobably 3-5 minutes then turned slightlyNorthwest and just seemed to stop and hang.Only one object/light was seen. Both of usare 59 years old and teachers. I (husband)spent 24 years in the u.s. air force. Time nowis 2117 and the object is still sitting still near the moon in clear sky. The moon is in the Southeast since this all started.
19970720	19970721	 Conway, SC	 diamond	At least a couple of hour	Summary : The event took place near Conway, SC on 7/20/97.  I saw an object that resembled a plane but it wasn&apos;t because it hovering about 2 to 300 feet of the ground.  It was too big to be a helicopter.The object seen resembled a plane but wasn&apos;t because it hovering of the ground say about 2 to 300 feet.  It was to large to be a helicopter.  It has 4 visible white lights two of which were shining off into the distance.  The other two were just lit up.  I also saw a smaller green and red light.  The shape of the object appeared to be the it had some sort of wings or maybe it was a diamond shape but I could not see inbetween the lights.  A description of myself is that I am 15 and I was riding in a car back from Flordia.  I am a honors student at my school in New York and have no criminal record.  My father is 42 and is currently studying to get his MBA.  My step mother is an employee at Bald Head Island in NC.  My cousin is 15 and she resides in WV.

19970424	19970424	 New Brighton, MN	 triangle	45 minutes	Summary : 20-35 triangular shaped craft sighting.Bright flashing lights at corners.13 yr old male 43 yr old female-Masters Degree(No previous sightings)13 yr old spotted bright light in east from interiorof the home.  Went to investigate and then saw a large object in the eastern sky.  He called his mother who also went to investigate.  The first and what would also be the largest of the craft was the firstlight seen.  It was the brightest light we had ever seen in the sky except sun and moon.  The craft was triangular in shape with lights on the corners.  When it was right overhead, a small triangular structure could be seen on the underside.  It hovered for a while and then was approached by another smaller craft.The large one began to turn north west and the smaller craft followed.  The craft abruptly turned and went due north.  Then after they were overthe horizon, more of the smaller sized craft began to be seen from the south moving north.They appeared one at a time in approx. two minute intervals.  It took them less than two minutes to go from horizon to horizon.  We had never seen any craft move that quickly.  Many of them maneuvered in distint manners:forward-reverse, forward-reverse; hover; very quick zigzag; 45+ degree banks in a matter of seconds:  almost as if a display.  Light pattern:  one light on one wing would flashand then the other two would follow.  Colors of the lights were white in front, blue and redon the sides and smaller amber to red on the inside of the triangle, making a perfect equilateral triangle inside the craft perimeter.Sound:  At first like a plane, but then a high pitched hum could be heard particularly when the craft was right over us.  A while afterwards,almost like blowing over the top of a tube.More than 20-35 of these were seen over the course of approximately 45 minutes, traveling from thesouth, some going northwest, some northeast, and some traveling directly overhead to the north.

19960901	19970620	 Fort Collins, CO	 disk	45 sec	Summary : 9/1/96 SIGHTINGAround 9:30 pm, Sunday, September 1st, 1996, my wife and I were in our backyard watching the sky.  This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded &ldquo;God, I do.&rdquo;As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, &ldquo;Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there&rdquo; to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.  If so, please e-mail us at: ((email address deleted.))
19950503	19971130	 Alden, NY	 light	10-20 minutes	Summary : I was just about to goto bed and I looked out my window for some strange reason and I looked to the south and I saw this very bright light in the sky. The object was going up at a fast rate and when it went behind the clouds you could see the clouds! The object looked flat from a distance and it had no flashing lights on it to tell me that it was a airplane or heliocopter. It had two bright lights that were side by side with a small space in between. I opened my window and I couldn&apos;t hear a sound. I live in the country and there isn&apos;t a lot of noise that I hear besides crickets. It startled me a lot. When it reached a point in the sky, it sat there for a couple of minutes, pulsing with its lights. Then it moved very quickly over to the West and sat the for a couple minutes again pulsing. Then it got very bright and then it just disappeared.the object seemed very large and flat from a distance. There were two very bright lights side by side going upwards. no sound, no blinking lights to indicate it was a airplane or heliocopter. when it stopped, it was pulsing. very lightly. When the object was in the West, It got very bright it had a somewhat blue tint to the light when it got bright. and then it just disappeared.....
19950310	19970402	 Coconino Nat&apos;l Forest north of Wupatki NM, AZ, AZ	 formation	10-15 min.	Summary : Man and woman observe cluster of about 8, motionless blinking blue lights (not in sync), lazer-like pulses of light between them, and ground hovering white light for 15 minutes.This event occured a little over two years ago while my then fiancee and I were camping in one of my favorite and extremely remote locations just north of Wupatki National Monument in Arizona.  We both witnessed the event for its duration and had both worked as National Park Rangers prior to this sighting.  I havn&apos;t reported this officially until now because I thought we were probably the only ones to see such a thing, and that few would believe us.  Recent news reports of sightings in that exact area promted me to write this in the case it could be helpful.  My fiance and I split up not too long after this event and havn&apos;t spoken since.  She could be contacted for independent verification, if someone wanted to do so.  She was really frightened by what happened and hence missed some of what I saw, but I think she saw the majority of what I am about to report.  The incidident:  I drove out cross-country to my favorite area in my 4Runner and parked it facing East, about 100 ya!rds from the edge of a long, low mesa extending North and South.  The landscape dropped off to the East towards the Little Colorado River and the Navajo Res.  We built a campfire near my lowered tailgate and began to enjoy the evening.  At one point, I was sitting on the tailgate facing West while my fiance was tending the fire.  I looked straight up at the sky, and in my peripheral vision caught sight of a blinking light.  At first, I just thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn&apos;t moving at all.  Then, I noticed from 5-7 other blinking lights in the same general quadrant of the sky--and outstretched hand would probably &quot;capture&quot; the space they all occupied.  I think they were whitish blue, but they may have been light red (I&apos;m sorry, I really can&apos;t recall exactly) and were not blinking in unison.  None were moveing at all.  This is why I kept watching them and told my fiance to look at them.  Then, we saw a lazer-like pulse of light shoot from one to another.  I thi!nk I saw this happen 2, maybe 3 times.  Then we noticed a whitish yellow light--much like a distant headlight--travelling near the ground in the distance ahead (East) of us.  At first I thought it was a car or motorcyle--but I&apos;ve never seen any other person out as far as I went, and certainly never at night... About the time I was beginning to worry that it was someone travelling toward I light, it went up and then back down a few degrees offf the horizen.  It continued to repeat this as it travellied along.  Most of the terrain there is fairly level, so I started doubting it was a car.  I put out the fire and had my fieance turn off her headlamp (she was too scared to do so).  When I looked back at the whitish light, it was apparently moving in our direction--but I couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was...at one point I thought for certain it was only 50 yards in front of us.  But there was no sound at all, so I figured I must be wrong.  Then we looked back up to the sky to see if!the other lights were still there; they were.  But when we looked out to the East for the whitish light, it was gone.  Then I noticed the same bluish or reddish (I think blue) lights blinking in the NW sky!  They had moved from the SE to the NW.  And then, to the N, we saw the whitish light travelling along the ground again...going up and down periodically like no car or earthbound vehicle could have done.  I t was almost as if it was searching for something.  Then it disappeared and the lights in the NW sky were gone too.  We slept in the back of my truck and had a restless night&apos;s sleep.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen (though we both did sight one UFO each when much younger).  I always wondered if the military was conducting some advanced lazer weaponry by sattelites--but this never does quite explain the white object hovering near the ground.....The next day, oberservations of the terrain in the directions we saw the white light made it even more clear that it!could not have been a vehicle.  Background information:  I was 33 at the time, and my fiance 29.  We both have bachelors degrees and some other training.  We were very healthy and didn&apos;t do any drugs or drink alcohol, etc.  We had each worked as National Park Rangers, and I was/am more of a skeptic than anything else.  I used to love to read the Skeptical Inquirerer!  Now I am more open to various possibilities, but I still thing it could have been some type of military operation.  I sure would like to know!  Hope this helpful in some way; if you need more into, please contact me at any time.
19970403	19970512	 Seattle, WA	 other	2-4min	Summary : I was on highway 520 going home and saw a black, silent &quot;elongated key&quot; shape traveling south over lake WA dissappered (cut into clouds)over Renton. I watched it as I was stuck in rush hour traffic.It was approxamatly 1 KM long and didn&apos;t seem to get smaller as it traveled away.the day was partially cloudy  yet clear I was travelling east on the floating deck of the 520 bridge I looked over to the right (south) and thought I saw a flock of birds however I realized it was something else. Black,silent and traveling south I noticed it over Medina and it went out over the middle of the lake then started traveling south until it dissappered (cut into the clouds) over Renton(WA)..
19971114	19971116	 Mukilteo, WA	 formation	1-2 minutes	Summary : Two large bright lights leading streams of hundreds, or many thousands of smaller bright lights, streaming across the sky.Driving home.  Saw the lights in the sky.  They were heading North horizontally arcoss the sky.  Very visible.  Other witnesses on the road in front of us thought they were UFOs bombs.  We didn&apos;t know, and we frightened.  When we lost sight of the lights it was not because they dissipated, but rather moved behind some trees and out of our range of vision.  Seemed to move faster than airplane, but much slower than shooting star. Local news is very vauge on what this could have been. Would like to find out more - what are the possibilities?  Wondering if it could have been a natural phenomenon, that no one has considered?  Could it be some military exercise, or experiment?  Mass in sky much larger than could be created by Russian rocket - mass would indicate debris from something the size of Washington State - can&apos;t think of anything man made that could have created that much debris in the sky, with the light so bright, rocket should have burnt out and dissipated.
19970806	19970807	 Wichita, KS	 light	15-30 seconds	Summary : Lights hanging in sky northeast of homeLeaving house for work and looked up into the sky.  Saw lights hanging in sky. 2 rows of dim lights parallel to each other (not blinking or flashing)and @ 3-4 second intervals, brighter lights tracked from right to left between the two rows of dimmer lights.  I was unable to see any structure either above or below the lights.  The morning sky was dark.  This object did not move or make any sound.  I decided to alter my route to work slightly to get a better look at the object and as soon as I had gotten into my car and backed out of the driveway and looked over my shoulder the object had vanished. There is an air force base in the southeast part of the city as well as a commercial airport to the west.  I often see and hear aircraft near my home, sometimes some pretty sofisticated types, like the wing.  But, the behavior of this object was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.

The object fell behind the treeline and there was no impact witnessed.
19950928	19970701	 Scottsdale, AZ	 fireball	10-15 Seconds	Summary : Sighting of lone fireBall on 09/28/95.In the hours between 8pm and 10pm.On 09/28/95 I along with family was driving home from dinner to wards Fountain Hills Arizona. I was sitting in the front passanger seatand observed one firery object which I thought were plane lights.  Then I thought it was a missle of some sort.  A ballof fire with a tail.  A comet no.  The ball of fire was traveling on a level plane. The fireball was quite close say 100 yards. It did not come from some distancejust poped in then poped out. (In to a dark small cloud but diddn&apos;t come out the other end.)  My family did not see the objectbecause I did not tell them. (They know I study ufo&apos;s, and they think I&apos;m Wack.)  A big storm hit that night. I recently moved to Arizona10 day prior.  I don&apos;t feel I&apos;ve never been abducted, my life has many oddities that might say that I was.)  This is not the first sightihgI have had in my life.

19970704	19970720	 Rockport, IN		2 seconds	Summary : Blue Light in the shyWe were on a farm shooting off fireworks.  Close to the end, several of us noticed a blue light heading straight down.  We all looked at each other and said, &quot;That&apos;s not normal!&quot;  I didn&apos;t think of it any more until I read about the sightings of a similar object in St. Louis.((NUFORC Note:  Many other sightings of the same phenomenon reported to our Center.  Please see other reports.  PD))
19780109	19970703	 Thousand Oaks, CA	 circle	60 seconds	I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and was lying awake in bed looking out the window.  I saw a large round yellow glowing object close to the ground far off in the distance and did not take note of it because I thought it was a full moon close to the ground.  It was partially blocked by some thin trees.As I lay there, the object began to ascend very very slowly.  As it began moving, I jumped out of bed and ran to the window watching as it rose above the tree level and house level.  I cannot tell how far off it was -- perhaps a few miles.Once it finished rising, it sat in the sky for a few seconds not moving -- then in a split second shot off to the right, disappearing.  I ran out of my room, down the hall, and into the living room which was the direction that the object flew.  I looked out of the sliding glass door in the living room, but the object was gone.Again, it was just a round, glowing, yellow object, with no other distinctive features.I have only told a very few select individuals about this over the past almost 20 years -- people that I knew would at least believe that I was not lying to them -- even if they don&apos;t happen to believe in UFO&apos;s.  When I heard about your organization, I figured I would at least log this siting with you -- perhaps it can help you  in some way.
19970316	19970623	 Salton Sea, CA	 other	45 minutes	Summary : Saw across the Sea a big red flash, then white-orange orbs appear, about 10-15, not moving, all in a straight line except for one which was to the left which move horizontally towards the rest.  They stayed for about 15 minutes, then went out about the same time.  Then about 10 minutes later, appeared again all shifted over to the left.  Again, more large red flashes on the ground, the horizon.  No sound could be heard at all throughout the entire time.Started with a big red flash across the Salton Sea, the East side.  We were on the West visiting a friend.  Then, moments afterwards, bright white-orange glowing orbs began to appear in the sky, above the horizon.  Approximately 10-15, all lined up and appeared to not move -- they were more or less in a straight line.  Except for one larger one off to the left, which moved towards the others slowly.  We wathed for about 15-20 minutes, all trying to figure out what it was.  Could not hear any sound at all, even after the big red flashes.Then, saw another big red flash on the horizon, not in the sky.  Then, they went out all about the same time.  Two of us remained to see if the lights would come back.  They did.  But this time all shifted to the left.  Again in a straingt line and again the big red flashes on the ground.  They stayed for about 15 minutes, with one to the left noticiably moving, the others not moving, then went out again at the same time.  We left for home shortly thereafter.  ((Name deleted))
19970313	19970417	 Phoenix, AZ	 formation	5 min +	Summary : 4 orange lights at about 30&apos; elevation looking to the North/North-East. Appeared in a wide trapazoid formation. Very slow moving.Four bright orange lights were seen just after sundown at about 30&apos; elevation looking to the North/North-East. They were in a trapazoid-type formation. We also noticed some smaller white lights appearing around the orange lights that looked as if they might have been associated in some way. The lights seemed to be moving very slowly toward the South. The formation gave the impression of a plane, only much, much larger.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct time of the sighting to have been approximatel 2030-2040 hrs..  We have changed the time here.  PD))
19970619	19970712	 Gladewater, TX	 other	30 minutes	Summary : It was an overcast night when a frind and I were leaving to go out for the night when I told my friend to look up and he couldn`t belive it.So I tried to call the airforce base in Shreveport La. But I couldn`t get anyone there.I also tried to contact N.A.S.A. to see if anyone else had noticed it but there was no answer there either.It looked like a bright orange streak in the sky,it was very bright considering the thickness of the clowdes.Still to this day I have not found out what it was.overcast night,long orange streak that seemed to stand still.it was very bright for about 30 minutes then it faded away.There was only one.the background of my friend and I was dark and in a open area.
19970306	19970307	 Rohnert Park (Sonoma State University), CA	 sphere	Three(3) hours +	Summary : I 1st noticed 3 small objects/stars/points &quot;excited state&quot;, were Iscoceles  their locations from each other.  One then vanished, two remained, became very active, then the largest white shooting star  tail/streak wen directly between the two. To me, it seemed as if the 3rd object&quot;took off&quot; into space. The white began and ended in a direction from Earth towards space. It was very 3-Dimensional and I believe the object exited our atmosphere from a stationary position to a 1 second blast towards space.The sky remained very lively while numerous larger objects/crafts floating like hot air balloons, changing colors from blue-green-red-gold.  10-30 degress above horizon remained active with &apos;excited&apos;small colored objects  defitely moving in all directionns, above were many slower but larger and clearer object, color displays and changes were very mech/electrical, not slow changes as if reflected light from Hale-Bopp,which was always present in the North Eastern sky. Many totally v!ertical risings and decents of objects of difeerent size and color. Helicopter?Hawk planes?  Sky quickly became less active, darker, as many objects exited view.  Sky balck with few stars @4:00am. Sunrise brought about much actvity on black sillouteted hills.  Huge dark craft rose vertically to top of hills and remainded. moonrise 6;00am
19970609	19970619	 Doylestown, PA	 triangle	15 seconds	Summary : V-shaped object / glowed with dim lightI saw this object traveling across the skyat a very high rate of speed. Suddenly itshot upward, (almost like an outside loop),then dove at that ground in the distance.It was then completly out of sight.The object made no sound.The object appeared to be in the shape of agiant V. The object glowed with a strange,almost flourescent color light.I put the incident out of my mind, untillyesterday while looking at a front page picturein &quot;The USA TODAY, there was the object I hadobserved 2 weeks previous.
19971201	19971211	 San Jose, CA	 triangle	2-3 min.	Summary : It was a clear starlit night when I noticed an object in the south-eastern sky.  At a distance I assumed it was an airplane on the flight path to the international airport in the north-west. When it got close, only five lights were visible in an enormous triangular configuration.  Three lights were large, bright white, unblinking, and made a smaller triangle at the forward point of the object, the other two lights were dim, white, unblinking, and at the other two corners of the larger triangle.  It was 3 or 4 times the size of a passenger jet, and under 2000 feet, but no engine noise could be heard.Monday, December 1, 1997 	At about 9:45PM tonight I was driving southward on the Monterey Highway when I noticed what was either an experimental air craft or else I&rsquo;ve had a sighting of one of the new triangular ufos.  I initially thought I was observing the bright landing lights of a couple of incoming commercial jet liners, since they were in the usual flight path for San Jose International Airport from the southeast toward the northwest. 	However, when I was stopped at the signal near the Edenvale shopping center on the approach to the Blossom Hill underpass, I was able to clearly see something which was not a plane with which I am familiar.  I wondered if it might have been some kind of stealth plane, because I could not make out the body of the plane against the night sky.  All I could see was five lights. 	Three lights were very bright, they were larger than normal running lights, and they were arranged in a tight equilateral triangle on the bottom of what I thought may be a plane&rsquo;s fuselage (the triangle was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length).  But, if it is a conventional or experimental airplane, the fuselage is two or three times as wide as most commercial jets.  There were also two small white lights placed where I imagined the wingtips were located aft of the triangle, (from the triangle to a &ldquo;wingtip&rdquo; was about the span of a 5 inch ruler held at arms length, or it was between 11 and 12 inches from tip to tip) but once again, they indicated a much wider wing span than is typical. 	Looking for a place to park and observe the craft, I rolled down the window and turned off the radio to see if I could hear the engine, but I could not.  It may have been too high, although its unusually large size indicated it was low enough to hear (perhaps a couple thousand feet above the highway).  If it was too high to hear, then its dimensions had to be too enormous to contemplate. 	I proceeded onto the cloverleaf and emerged slowly onto the eastbound side of Blossom Hill so I could look toward the craft&rsquo;s flight path, but it was long gone.  Never-the-less, off in the distance, on the same path were some large red lights which I assumed were probably the tail lights of the same air craft, primarily because they also were much larger than the running lights of most planes. 	 	I also watched other planes to make a comparison.  As expected, I was able to clearly see the bodies of the other planes.  I also found that their lights were not configured like those of this large craft, nor were the lights as bright, or as large.  Furthermore, there were the usual flashing lights on the airplanes, but all the lights of the other craft were steady and unblinking.

19730801	19970629	 Morrow, GA	 triangle	5 mins.	Summary : Metallic, grey, triangular object hovers just above tree top level behind house as we stood approx. 150 &apos; away on a clear summer night.  No sounds were heard.Object:   1 Grey, metallic, triangular in shape, points of triangle were rounded, not pointed.  Size:  15x15x15&apos;  one side had rows of white lights about the brightness of a car head light.  Lights were larger at the base and decreased in size as they neared the top.Interested in astromony I&apos;ve always observed the night sky.  Exiting my friends house in Morrow, GA this clear evening, (full moon).  We stood on the edge of her yard, I leaning against the car, preparing to go home near midnight, she facing me with back to house.  I happen to glance up and noticed this object hovering directly behind her house at tree top level.  It made no noise nor did it move initially.  I pointed it out to my air-head friend who glanced at it over her shoulder then remarked that it was probably a helicopter.  She kept gabbing thus I basically ignore it momentarily.  I remarked that if it were a helicopter then it wasn&apos;t making any noise.   She looked again, waved her arm and continued gabbling.  I kept glancing up at it over 4-5 mins time.  The next to the last time I looked up, it begin to very slowly rotate on its side.  As it did, I saw the rows of lights.  They did not appear to blink but remained on.  I told her to look again.  She commented, &quot;I don&apos;t know what it is and I don&apos;t care!&quot;  The next time I looked up it was gone!  Again, I asked her to look and explain what could have happened to it.  She gave no answer nor was she really interested.I would like to know if any other reports have been submitted regarding sightings in this area.  I recall reading an article in the Atlanta Journal during the 1970-73 time frame about ufo sightings in the state of GA.  Can you shed some light on this.  In my reading is seems like most sightings are not of triangular shapes.  Thank you for your help.  I will submit a drawing via mail.

19970620	19970708	 Sunnyside (Granger, on Hwy 82), WA	 light	5 min.	Summary : 3 bright red lights clustered together,  at first thought airplane, no running lights or no sound, flew over Outlook Wa. and headed for Hanford.I was driving my truck, going to Toppenish Wa. just passed Outlook Wa. and in the southwest I saw 3  bright red lights clustered together, for about 30 sec. I kept driving, I stop the truck, got out, I watch the 3 clustered lights as it headed northeast  and it started to gain altitude, I thought a first this was a airplane or helicopter, but it made no sound or no running lights, very little traffic at 12:35 am.  Speed was about 35 to 40 mph,  then, it started picking up speed, at about that time it was over Outlook Wa. About 80 sec. had passed, I watch it as it headed for  Hanford Wa. a total of about 5 min. had passed since I first saw the ufo, I was about to lose sight of it,  the lights started to pulsate, the lights were very bright now as they pulsated. then I lost sight of it. I&apos;m guessing it was about 30 miles away.the radio and tv tower lights  near Yakima Wa. is about 25 miles and I could see them very  clearly

19970518	19970520	 Grantville (Rte. 443 and Appleby Road), PA	 triangle	10sec	Summary : in church parking lot, my son and aunt, see triangle fly over head.at the intersection of RT 443 AND APPLEBY RD. very fastSightings report.........My 10 year old son asked  me&quot; how can we tell if a UFO is good or bad?&quot; yesterday. So I ask why. He replied that he and my sister in law had seen a fling triangle on Sunday evening may 18th while standing in our church parking lot. I asked him to draw a picture of what he saw and he did. Which fit perfectly with what I understand them to look like. I don&apos;t think he has ever seen a picture of a flying triangle so I feel his report is completely truthful. He has seen saucer type crafts in photos, but not triangles. His description is as follows. It was a perfect triangle with lights on each side. The drawing showed 5 lights per side where the end light would be counted on both sides.  12 lights total. He said its was about 1 inch long and moved much faster than any plane. The location was out in the country away from any small towns. It was on route 443 at the Appleby RD intersection. About 7 miles northeast of Harrisburg pa. And 4 miles north of Grant!ville pa. I will attempt to confirm the report with my sister in law on Monday. Until then.

0000	19970722	 Hampshire, TN	 cigar	10-15 min	Summary : My husband and a a handful of men who were sitting in front of the Hampshire Mens Club, when one of the men pointed to a spot above a large tree across the highway, and asked what it was.  My husband and the men saw a gigantic round object, lighted organge and surrounded by a haze that clung to the object and was also orange.  They heard no noise from the object.  Within a few minutes, the object turned sideways so that it assumed the classic &quot;cigar&quot; shape, then moved off, disappearing within seconds.  I asked my husband to describe the size in terms of &quot;hold your arm out straight, pretend you&apos;re sighting down your arm and tell me approximate size in inches&quot;.  He held his hands apart about 2 feet. After this encounter I contacted CUFOS (sp?), and they claimed it was a satellite that had been launched from Virginia that night.  when I relayed this to my husband, he burst out laughing.  He said only if the satellite visited middle Tennessee first. I relayed this story to a friend who at the time was in the astronomical society in Shreveport, Louisiana.  She said on that same night, two men at the boservatory had spotted the same thing, only smaller.  One of these men had a call from his mother in Michigan, who reported the same sighting. I am not dead sure of my dates--but I would like very much to know if anyone else recalls seeing a similar objecft at the same time.Bright orange, no sound, surrounded by a haze that reflected the orange light, round at first sight, then turning to present the side.  My husband is a heavy equipment mechanic who reads no UFO literature, never has and probably never will.  The other men are older, retired men.

19960622	19970329	 Buckhannon, WV	 triangle	2minutes	Summary : A rather large triangular shaped disk was noticed about 800 yards away hovering at the level of tree tops.  Me and a friend began to examine the craft and noticed a strange light configuration.  Three small lights in each corner (red) and a pulsating lght in the center (orange).  Until that day we were both sceptics.The ship was making making no sound at all and was sitting absolutely still.  We exited the car and began to get a better look.  It was very large in a perfect triangular shape.  The lights at each corner were very small in comparison to the large center light and were also not pulsating.  They were red in color but appeared to fade slightly into an orange in the center.  In the middle of the craft was at first glance an orange light but after careful examination was hanging down like a large ball of light pulsating and fading and then restoring to full brightness.  We then realized that the road permitted a closer look.  We entered the car and began towards it.  We ran under a passing of trees and then cleared them.  the veiw of the ship was elliminated by the trees.  Upon reaching the other side the ship was gone from sight.  The sides appeared to slope inward at an angle from bottom to top.
19890101	19971103	 Memphis, TN	 light	varying	Summary : On sequential nights during the month of January, 1988, I witnessed from 2-4 bright amber lights hovering or slowly moving in the western sky over Memphis. On one night, these lights appeared to be performing some sort of synchronized movements, moving in large circles at antipodes from each other, and reversing direction.I just finished watching the special on the Discovery channel about the lights seen over Phoenix during March of &apos;97. I was impressed by the videos of the supposed &apos;flares&apos;, and was reminded of a similar occurance many years ago. Over the course of the month of January 1988, only on weekend nights as these were the only nights I was out, I witnessed in the western sky over Memphis, sometimes 2, and sometimes 4, bright amber lights similar in appearance, color, and &apos;texture&apos; to flames seen from a great distance. Each night after 0100, while driving south down Old Germantown Road, I saw these lights above the western horizon, in the direction of Memphis International Airport. Sometimes the lights merely hovered, or moved very slowly, almost too slow to notice movement, but on one occasion, my curiosity having been excited by previous sightings, I noticed two objects moving in a large circle, as though orbiting a central point- the circle being approxiamtely 3x the size of a fu! ll moon. The objects maintained a 180 degree opposition to each other as they circled, and once a circle was completed, they reversed direction to complete another circle, before reversing direction again. On this particular night (I cannot remember the exact date), I stopped the car to watch them, and sat parked for about 15 minutes before I got bored, having watched them perform 3 complete circles, so i continued on my way, sure that I would see them again on some other night. And I did, but never again were they so active as on that night. Since then I have seen similar phenomena which proved to be landing lights of comercial aircraft approaching over a great distance on a clear night: the same color and quality of light, the same apparent slow movement, but I have never before or since witnessed such a &apos;ballet&apos; in the sky. It seems remarkable and highly unlikely that any comercial or military aircraft could move with such precision being separated over so large an area as ! was suggested by the apparent distance from my vantage point, and even more unlikley that such aircraft could stop and reverse direction without slowing.  I have never before reported this because it seemed to me too weak a sighting to be of much consequence; I was never able to identify the objects as anything more than &apos;lights in the sky.&apos; But after seeing the Phoenix videotapes, I was amazed by the similarity to what I saw over those nights so long ago. These were not my only encounters during the same 12-month period, but it has been so long now, I don&apos;t that my information can be of much value. I am, however, interested in relating what I have seen, both in the sky and elsewhere, to interested scientific and documentary authorities.  If needed, i can supply photocopies of maps showing my position and the direction of the sightings.
19971102	19971103	 Green Bay, WI	 light	appx. 10 mins.	Summary : A loose formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights observed slowly crossing evening sky.A formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights was observed  11/02/97  18:50  Green Bay, WI  When first spotted by my mother[49], they were in a roughly triangular formation, moving slowly east.  She called for me to come outside and look at somthing.  I went out and watched them for about 5 minutes until the upper two were slowly enveloped in the cloud cover.  I went inside and got my SLR camera &amp; 400mm lens.  I went back out and looked at the remaining light, but the strong lens showed revealed no shape behind the light.  The other two lights now began to emerge from the clouds and the formation of the three was now close to linear and vertical.  I would estimate their distance to be about 2-3 miles.  I couldn&apos;t tell if they were making any sound because a helicopter was hovering 1.3 miles to the west, over the football stadium.  The orange lights had no accompanying aircraft-style strobes or red/blue positioning lights.  They did not move constantly, as a sattelite would and! the cloud cover was dense enough to obscure anything that high or faint.  I am 34 and I am quite familiar with the way civil and military aircraft move.  These lights moved similarly to helicopters, but had no regulation lights and didn&apos;t generate the sounds that a group of 3 military helicopters would make.  I asked a neighbor to look at them.  He did, but looked for 3 seconds, said &quot;Oh, airplanes&quot;, and went back inside. I was looking for film inside for 2 minutes and when I went back outside, the 3 lights had vanished.
19811018	19970728	 Detroit/Warm Springs (between, Cascade Mts.), OR	 cigar	one hour	Summary : Single small vehicle left main body and followed us in a hovering helicopter fashion for over 45 minutes while we were walking from the west. Then from the East it flew around Forked Butte and came at us less than ten ft. off the snow covered ground.The vehicle then rapidly (popped) approached us from the East and landed ten ft. in front of us, turned out its bright white light and turned on an interior light revealing the semi-transparent red, green &amp; blue lens. The vehicle then exited rapidly and climbed into space and disappeared behinfd Mt. Jefferson. The vehicle emitted sparks from the stern much like a 1930&apos;s &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; space vehicle. On Sunday evening at approx. 10 pm Dec. 22, 1981 myself, my 11 yr. old son and another person were &quot;buzzed&quot; by over 12 of these same vehicles. We witnessed them flying up to a larger cigar shaped vehicle and started orbiting around it. The whole system then rose up into the night sky and disappeared. I interviwed Police catain Ellidge ! and Lt. Horton who recieved over a thousand phone calls concerning individuals from Eugene in February 1982. I reported the incident to the FBI. Since then we have studyed in depth the technology we were shown and hence got a U.S. patent ont the technology in 1989. We intend to build and test prototypes soon. Please visit our website to review this technology at http://www.unitelnw.com. The Medford incident may be the same vehicles. I believe they are our own vehicles that we are about to build attempting to return to the correct spacetime departure point. Thank you, Sincerely,

Valley), WA	 circle	5 minutes	Summary : Circular, bright metallic object hovering, seemingly dissapearing and reapearing in the same place high in the sky in South King County, WA.I was travelling to work at 8:30am on Southbound I-5 on Tuesday, December 9th, 1997.  I first noticed this small, circular, metallic object (highly reflective) high in the sky approximately 11:00 position, 45 degrees from my vantage point.  It appeared to be probably over the city of Auburn.   I had just gotten on I-5 from the 405, Southcenter interchange, so I saw the object for about 5 minutes off and on.  It appeared to dissapear and then reappear in the same spot at least three times.  If this was a trick of my eye I cannot say.  The sun would hit it at times and the whole thing would appear to light up brighter than you would expect from a conventional plane.  (I am sending a .jpg image I created as an example..File 12997.jpg) By the time I neared Fife, I lost sight of it.  I am a computer graphic designer with an interest in UFOs, but have never seen anything like this in the skies before.

19650101	19970525	 Conway, AR	 light	1 hour	Summary : At a drive-in during the summer my brother and I saw three lights above and to the right of the screen.  The movie was &quot;CAT BALOU.&quot; We observed them for approx. 20 minutes while one of them flew figure eights around the other two.  Then one of the other lights would switch positions with the moving light and fly the same figure eight pattern.  Suddenly two of the lights took off with great velocity and dissappeared.  The other light stayed in its orginal position.  Approx. 1 hr. later a light came speeding back and started circling the stationary light then took a position next to it and stopped.  I am at home with my sick child today and watching the learning channel and heard a pilot report a similar sighting.  I finally decided to go public
19971212	19971213	 Lubbock, TX	 other	bedroom	Summary : sleepover. flashing lights. blankets ripped off bed. tall thin figures &quot;spoke&quot; to us. abduction. woke with strange triangular marks on our bodies that vanished within hours. constant feeling of being watched. S.O.S.Me and my friend are 14 years old.  We had stayed up late studying for finals.  We went to bed at about 12 and stayed up till about 1 afeter talking about school.  At about 2 we were both awakened suddenly to a strange silence and bright flashing lights out side the window.  We both remember a sence of absolute shock and severe fright, when our covers were suddenly and yet gently drawn from our beds.  At the foot of my bed I saw a   the silouette of a tall thin figure with  large black eyes that had a shiney luster to them, it was as if I could see myself in them,(after this moment I regret to say that the rest is the account of my friend because I cannot remember anything else)......I looked over at Patty and I remember thinking that she was dead because she lie so still.  her body began to rise above the bed into the arms of the figure described above. I also was &quot;carried&quot; into the figures arms, but i did not pass out. Before I knew it, we were in a different place that is defficult to describe because i was surrounded by these figures.  I was laying on a strange surface that was both hot and cold at the same time. It felt as if there was a sheet over my body put there so that i could not move.  The only part of my body that i could move was my eyes.  I did not see Patty anywhere, until the beings parted for a split second, and i caught sight of them carrying her body out of the room, i was sure she was dead. i then directed my eyes toward the celing and saw an  object slowly and silently descending toward my stomach.  It resembled a very large needle, and it was then that i fainted.  i awoke in the morning laying beside Patty on the kitchen floor. We vaguely (at first) remembered what had happened.  We noticed three strange triangular marks on our bodies--one behind the left ear, one on our stomachs, and one on our lower back.  Now Patty and i feel that if we ever separate after this experience together, somthing bad will happen.
19970326	19970327	 Owings Mills, MD	 light	5 minutes	Summary : Bright white object observed to the West at about treetop level, gained altitude and flew off silentlySaw a bright white object which appeared to be hovering at treetop level a few miles to the West of my home in Owings Mills Md. The light was pulsating about once/second, and was much brighter than any aircraft light I had everseen. After a minute or two, it gained altitude and flew off to the southeast. As soon as it stopped hovering, the light dimmed to a more normal level. As it flew off, I sawa blinking red light near the white one. Itwas too  dark to see anything of the craft itself.I initially thought it was a Helicopter with a searchlight, but it was absolutely silent.  We have helicopter overflights on occasion,both military and commercial, and, at thedistance I observed this object, they arequite easily heard. The neighborhood wasquiet, and I should have been able to heara helicopter. Also, if it was a searchlight,it was not pointed at the ground as one wouldhave expected with a helicopter.I am a 40 year old Electronics Engineer, and am a stable individual. We just moved intothis house in Owings Mills last summer. Itis a more rural area than our last house,and has frequent overflights by military cargo planes flying in a corridor thatusually extends from the southwest to thenortheast.
19970701	19970704	 Omaha, NE	 disk	1 minute	Summary : UFO sighted in plain daylight cruising at low altitudeand without audible sound in Omaha.Two individuals sighted an unidentified flying objectat the same time on July 1st, 1997 at 3:20 pm from diffrentlocations in Omaha, NE.  One reports seeing asaucer-like object of a deep iron color with aribbed contour on the sides flying slowly andat low altitude across a clear cloudless sky.The object seemed to glide slowly then abruptlychange directions and disappear into the sky.The second individual also sighted the flyingobject but from a different angle.  The objectwas flying towards the observer.No audible sound was noticed. There seemed to bea bright light coming from the front part ofthe object.  This person confirmed the jaggedcontour of the object.Both observers found it odd that such an objectcould fly because of its design as it had nowings.
19970727	19970728	 Arlington, WA	 light	1-2minutes	Summary : Just went to bed, glanced out window and saw a white/yellow light in trees. Told friend, got binocluars and looked at it through them, saw a round light, got up and went into house. Friend said she saw a face and body outline in window.Just went to bed, glanced out the window and saw a white/yellow light in the trees. Told my friend and got the binocluars to get a closer look, to make sure it wasn&apos;t the moon. Saw through the binoculars a round white/yellow light, partially blocked by the trees. My friend said she saw a face and body outline in the window. Not human looking. More she looked at it the more clear it looked. I have seen many UFO&apos;s around my  house. Believe to be possibly abducted. I have reported them through this network before. My friend has also seen UFO&apos;s before and believe to have been abducted. The light also had beams coming off it, like it would have to be bright, the area around the light, below, was lite up by it. There is a house right where this object was.
19970831	19971010	 Newberg, OR	 light	approx. 5 min.	Summary : A woman and her sun witness 5 strange lights, white in the center, yellow between the center and edge, and blue. Does unearthly maneuvers, then vanishes from sight.My mom and I had just finished watching King of the Hill, when she went to the patio door to let Pixie and Desi, our cats, out. I noticed a strange group of lights, flying in direct patterns (they would go up, then stop, and go straight left or right. Their patern was like this: o ----- white 0   0   0 ----- yellow, white, yellow 0  0  0  0  0 ----- blue, yellow, white, yellow, blue 0 ----- white ,etc. I&apos;m a Trekkie, and X-Files fan, who would do nothing to harm any alien theories.

19750315	19970705	 Sao Paulo (Brazil),	 light	20 minutes	Summary : Hovering orange light over the train terminal of the city&apos;s subway and in line with the final approach of S.P. international airport. Hundreds saw it. The eve. news confirmed UFO.I was 13 at the time and was playing outside a church while my parents were in choir practice. It was dark. From the hill where the church sat, I could see the terminal station of the Sao Paulo subway system. Suddenly I noticed an orange light that changed intensity, sometimes changing to red. I called my parents and the other church members who came out to see. We were there for about 20 minutes. The location of the light was exactly on the path of the Sao Paulo International Airport (Congonhas) final approach. As airplanes would align with final, the light moved very fast and dissapeared, to reappear when tha plane had passed. Later that evening, channel 5 (Globo television network) reported the incident and interviewed several eye witnesses, who reported the same story. They also interviewed officials at the airport who reported an &quot;unidentified object&quot; on the radar screens at the reported location. Airline pilots also reported seeing the object. No further explanations w!ere given, and airforce officials declined to comment.The date is approximate, since I don&apos;t remember exactly when it happened. But it was around then.
19530615	19970718	 North Bend, WA	 circle	2 minutes	Summary : My cousin and I who were children at the time, watched a round, smooth, silent object which had a pinkish glow, come across his field from the direction of the Snoqualmie River.  It was about 20&apos;-30&apos; from the ground.  We were standing on his front porch.  It came in our direction and then stopped above a fruit tree directly across the driveway from where we were.  It was about the size of a VW Beetle, perfectly circular, with a triangular projection at the &quot;back.  My aunt had locked the front door to prevent us kids from running through the house.  I pounded on the door to get the adults to come out and see this thing.  My cousin said that when I started pounding and yelling, the object took off and streaked up over the mountain in the direction of the mountain (Rattlesnake mtn.), in the direction of Seattle.  Our parents brought us into the house and put us into different rooms and had us draw a picture of what we had seen.  Our pictures matched, and I remember that our par! ents believed that we had seen something.  The next day (as I remember it) my father told my mother that &quot;something &quot; was reported in the Seattle paper, streaking across the sky at about the right time for it to have been the thing we saw.  I was 9yo at the time as was my cousin.  We had both lived in Alaska and had watched airplanes and heliocopters landing near our home and knew that this was nothing like conventional aircraft.  It was perfectly silent; if we hadn&apos;t been looking we would never have known it was there.   It was completely featureless also. I remember people asking if there were windows or portholes or doors but we were firm that there were not.  We were very close to this object, no more than 50&apos; at the most.  It excited me and frightened me a little bit.  I thought that it stopped opposite us because it &quot;saw&quot; us.  I have never heard any other report of an object which looked like the one we saw.  It looked to me as though it had been manufactured, did not lo! ok like a natural object, was definitely not gaseous.  Anyone else out there ever see anything like this?  I am not sure of the date.  It is most likely that it was 1953 because I was still living in the Snoqualmie/North Bend area at the time and my family was visiting my cousin&apos;s family.  Interestingly and dissapointingly, my cousin does not remember the object as looking the way I describe it.  He now says it was silver and saucer-shaped.  It was not, and we agreed at the time on how it looked.  I remember being frustrated at not being able to really draw the way it looked.  I realize now that I couldn&apos;t replicate the geometrical precision of the thing.We were children of the same age, and had no background as such.  We knew nothing about &quot;flying saucers&quot; except that we must have heard talk about them because I remember explaining that it was not a &quot;flying saucer&quot;, it was round and had a tail.  My father was an employee of Seattle City Light and my mother did not work outside the home.  I was an only child at the time.  My cousin was one of 4 children,  His father was a logger and his mother was employed but I don&apos;t remember at what at that time.  We were semi-sophisticated kids in that we had traveled to Alaska by stemship with our families several times and had had the experience of living on the fringes of civilization as well as in the Seattle area.  Perhaps because I was an only child, I have an excellent memory and clear early memories. I realize that this is OLD information and not at all scientific but I don&apos;t know anyone else who has seen something like this so &quot;Up close and personal&quot;.  If I hadn&apos;t seen this thing! , I would never believe the reports I&apos;ve read about the objects other people have seen.  I empathize with the skeptics, it&apos;s just too fantastic.  But, since I have seen it, I can no longer doubt that there is something more to this world than we now &quot;know&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))
19971031	19971106	 El Paso, TX	 other	2 minutes	Summary : I saw  what appeared papers swirling high in the atmosphere. They changed into two huge white kite like objects which then turned into two blimp-like objects  which then began to fly southeasterly at the same height and rate as commercial jets, but were much bigger. As I began to lose sight of them, I called my husband on the west side of town (20miles away). He  saw what appeared as a shiny orb traveling southeasterly.Standing in my backyard, around 10 in the morning, I saw what appeared to be a jet in the northeastern sky. It was climbing very high  and very rapidly. Suddenly,in the northeastern sky I saw what appeared to be papers caught way up in the atmosphere . They appeared to be swirling downward. These &quot;papers&quot; took the shape of two huge white kite shaped objects  moving together. These then seemed to turn into  two huge white blimp shaped objects that were moving southeasterly one following the other at about the same rate and height as passenger planes. The sun was now striking them making them appear shiny. I called my husband who was on the west side of towm ( about 20 miles away). He saw  a shiny orb that seemed to zig-zag. From his angle he may hane been looking at the two objects  one flying lower than the other. This happened at ten in the morning on a bright sunny cloudless day  and it seems to have gone unnoticed.

We were hypnotized for a minute than we screamed and ran home.See above.
19970409	19970409	 Sarnia (Canada), ON	 unknown	30 seconds	Summary : On this particular night my sister and I went out to our side porch to have a cigarette when she noticed something suddenly appear to the east.  An aircraft of some sort appeared suddenly, sped across the sky at an unbelievable rate of speed, and then vanished.My sister was the first to notice the object as she was scanning the sky to see if she could catch a glimpse of the Hale-Bop comet, when she grabbed my arm and told me to look.  I glanced up at the sky towards the east and saw what I thought to be a small airplane taking off from the local Sarnia Airport.  The craft was probably only about 300 or so feet off the ground, well below the scattered clouds.  It flew slow at first, and I noticed a very bright white light, which looked like it was coming from the side of the craft due to it&apos;s direction.  The light flickered very quickly a few times, went out and then came back on.  It was flying quite slow at that time. Then all of a sudden it accellerated, darted across the sky towards the west and Michigan untill we couldn&apos;t see it any more.  It looked to have four light type things, one at the front, back, and the side facing us.  The light at the side was a very bright white light, that looked like it was sort of pointed downward!  It was very loud and sounded like a gigantic jet engine roaring extremely loud. The lights on the front and on the back were much dimmer, and looked to be green.  Judging by the lights on it, it looked to me like it was sort of round or had very short wings.  What I mean is that all the lights looked as though they were exactly the same distance apart giving it a square or circular looking shape. As it flew further away from us there looked to be a cluster of about 20 small white lights giving off an enormous glare.  It looked like it was about the same size as a fighter plane would be.  Once whatever it was sped up it moved across the sky faster than anything I&apos;ve seen and within about 15 seconds was too far away for us to see.  Neither my sister nor I have ever seen what we thought to be an alien craft or anything like that. Particularly, I am a very logical and scientific person who needs to see something to really believe it.  I recently had an argument with a friend who was trying to convince me that there are such things as bearded ladies.  My arguement to her was that I would never be able to truly believe something like that unless I saw it with my own eyes in person, because how can you really know? My point is that if I wouldn&apos;t have seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it.  I am usually very sceptical of UFO sightings and stuff on tv because the stories always have to many holes, and of course I had never seen one.  I have a 156 I.Q. and have always been thought of as very clear minded and mature far beyond my years.

19970508	19970510	 Sylmar, CA	 other	10 minutes	Summary : Object looking like a shooting star but going upward.  Going higher, a beam of light shone from the object until it disappeared.My son and I saw what looked like a very bright shooting star, going up and not down.  It had a very wide tail that was also very bright.  We watched it go up into the sky for a total of approximately 10 minutes.  As it went higher, the intensity subsided.  It was in the northwestern sky above the mountains.  It changed direction after going up for about 5 minutes.  It then turned to a more northerly direction as it got smaller and higher.  As we looked at it, my son and I both saw what looked like a wide beam of light coming from this object shining down to earth.  We couldn&apos;t see it go all the way down because the light was partly behind the mountains at that time.As the object kept getting higher, we also noticed a smaller light below this object, approximately 3 inches below, if using your fingers to measure.  It was moving in a northeastly direction and moved very fast and again, using your fingers to measure, it moved approximately 5 inches in that direction and then it disappeared.  The first object continued moving higher and then it too disappeared.We watched for a few minutes longer but could not see either object anymore.
19970829	19971008	 Lyons, CO	 disk	2 minutes	Summary : Two High School Girls see silver disk move over townMy daughters were at the High School playing field about 45 minutes before the start of a Football game when they looked up and saw a disk about the size of a dime held at arms length, (lower than the low clouds) move from the NE to the SW to W direction.  It moved slowly and the setting sun caused it to reflect light very brightly like an object of very smooth metal or glass.  The shape was that of a disk with a slight indentation in the center. It made no noise.  They have never seen anything like it before and did not really believe stories I had told them of UFOs I had seen before their birth.   I report this because I note that other sightings are being seen in the Wyo.&amp; Colo. area.  I also may have seen another one myself on about 8/4/97 just at sunrise, also over Lyons.  It too was reflecting the sun very brightly.  I kept it to myself because I did not see its shape.  It too made no sound though it was not very high over town and traveled N to S.
19960915	19970721	 Solomans Island, MD	 light	10 minutes	Summary : My wife and I first saw a bright light from the top of the bridge coming from St Marys County; a distance of 1/2 mile. As we drove closer, we saw a solid object floating about 20 feet above the tree tops.  I pulled the car over to the side of the road and we sat staring at this glowing object.  There was a house within the field of view, the diameter of the object was twice the length of the house. The object was constructed in 3 sections, the middle section had glowing rectangular panels, the bottom section was massively constructed and we could see ribbing.  There was no sound, the trees did not move, this all happened at twilight.  After discussing what we were looking at, I started the car and left; the object was still there when we left.My pragmatic wife doesn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s but she does admit that she saw this object. My wife is retired and I work at NASA.
19970515	19970620	 Asheville, NC	 other	both events 1 minuite	Summary : an object was sited around the asheville area that was travelling westward. it was brilliantly lit and appeared to be moving very fast.my partner and i were approaching an overlook on the blue ridge parkway just after nightfall, unfortunately, i cannot recall an exact date and time. as we approached the outlook, which was likely at an elevation of over 2000 ft., a solid, dazzling orange light appeared in the sky over the valley and was still for a moment. it then banked down and towards the right, and the brightness of the light dimmed and it moved. it reminded me of fire. we kept going hoping to get a better view. by the time we stopped the car there was no sign of the light. we exited off the parkway and went through all of the validity tests we could think of. no aircraft could manoeuvre with those angles and speeds at what seemed to be a fairly close distance to the mountain. we thought of as many other logical scenarios (hoping to find one) but nothing fit. as we neared the town of weaverville, we saw the same solid orange light move swiftly and low to the ground, but unfortunately our viewing angle wa!s poor and it was out of sight before long.we talked with a friend who lives on a mountain in the same area, who corraborated our story independantly, except he was able to see the complete path the object took for at least seven minutes. he said that hours later a fleet of helicopters passed in formation through the valley with searchlights, though there were no reports of crashed aircraft or any other crime scene that would call for a searchlight. i do have a belief that what we saw was extraordinary, but only after we have applied every rational test we could conceive of.
19971115	19971115	 Tucson, AZ	 other	3 seconds	Summary : Traveling east on Speedway Blvd. and saw a bright white/yellow object with a red streaking tail traveling low from southwest to northeast of Tsn.  Very bright and low in atmostphere.  Two others in cars slowed and looked up at it since it was so bright.  Moved somewhat slowly-not like a meteor.I am a cameraman for ((Name deleted)) Cable Access Show UFO AZ TALKS.  After the show we all go out for coffee.  I left at 12:30 am on Nov. 15, 1997.  I was traveling east on Speedway Blvd. just west of the UofA.  Traffic was light, skies were clear and cold.  As I was driving along I noticed a bright yellow/white object  with a red streaking tail behind it.  It was relativly low in atmosphere.  It traveled from Southwest to Northeast and went down behind the Mt. Lemmon area here in Tsn. Two other cars aloneside me on Speedway saw it and slowed down to look at it through their windshields.  It was spectacularly bright!!  Was listening to Art Bell when he started talking about some &quot;breaking news&quot; and then went to a break.
19971108	19971109	 Saugus, CA	 other	30 minutes	Summary : 2 ships were spottedtwo ships were spooted in the sky at about 6:20 pm on the 8 th of November.  We have seen this once before in the same spot in the sky in late July. Of the two ships one was really bright and one was not very bright. The bright one was glowing a hot white color, and when viewed with binoculars, it had what appeared to be two rocket boosters, which were tapering off in width, and where at about a 120 degree angle from eachother.  Also a white hot ring seemed to be floating around the ship.  Sort of like some sort of force feild.  The smaller ship was keeping a constant distance from the brighter bigger ship. Like it was bing controlled by it. The strangest and weirdest thing thathappened though was this bright band of light that crossed the sky. It was like a twisted plane or ribbon, twisting at the left, and then ging straight across the sky.  Then at the right side or the end of it it looped and went up.  Then it dissapeared. &gt;From the beginning of the sighting to the end, the brighter ship moved down and over a little to the right. The smaller ship seemed to move a lot more.  Then about an half hour later, the ribbon instantly vanished.

19971015	19971202	 Abingdon, VA	 light	~10 minutes	Summary : Bristol Herald Courier run on Thursday (10-16-97) the following day &quot;Unusual lights in sky over Mountain Empire generate speculation&quot;. Newspaper is in Bristol, VA - TN (two states city).I am only going to give a general entry. The newspaper said sighting was seen south of Kingsport, south of Bristol in the direction of South Holton Lake, I live near I-81 exit 22 and it was southwest of my home.  My son and I saw a vertical silver object (bright as if the sun was refecting off it) with a tail like a jet but more dense and one and three-fouths the lenght of the object. It did not change location during the time we would look at it.  I would not have even thought anything of it but for the fact that WXBQ-AM morning talk show was talking about it the next morning and right at the end of the program someone said they had seen it around 7:00 pm.  The newspaper had not printed a time but if others who phoned the local police and airport saw it about the same time, the sun was going down and it was far from being dark. The paper said one caller with binoculars saw what appeared to be an illuminated crystal shape similar to a snowflake with a dark center and number of red spots darting around it.  A BVPD Sgt. ((Name deleted)) used same binoculars and saw &quot;It looked like a bery intensely bright star with fainter looking objects around it or something red emitting from it...but I didn&apos;t see it moving, it appeared stationary&quot;. I do not now if the other two area papers ran a story about this but they would be the Johnson City or Kingsport (TN) papers.  We also have three TV stations WJHL, WKPT and WCYB.

19970420	19970422	 Reno, NV		5 sec.	A couple were looking to the north out the window of their room at the Peppermill Hotel.  They both noticed a peculiar, very bright white light coming from their right and moving away from them to the north.  It came from the direction of the airport in Reno.  The object was moving very fast, and it appeared to be descending slightly.
19970116	19970413	 Moab, UT	 other	3 min.	Summary : Very bright stationary object approx. 30 deg.off horizon.  Emitted triangular yellow greenlight, modulating from flood to spot beam.  Then UFOappeared to dissolve into a cloud of its own light.While visiting Arches Nat&apos;l Park shortly after sunset,still watching the western horizon, we saw an inexplicable lightappear from nowhere.  The Light approached then began to modulate into a beamalong the ground, and then into a wider flood and then back into the spot.There was no noise nor was there any apparent vessel.  Aftermodulating a couple times the light simplydiffused into a nebulous cloud of light.  Theair was cold and dry that day and there hadnot been any clouds in the sky previous tothis sighting.
19971216	19971217	 North San Diego, CA	 fireball	apx. one second	Summary : Green fireball.  Seemed to be too low for a celestial event.  Definitely not fireworks.I&apos;m an engineer.  See myself as a careful, objective observer.  Know planes, seen lots of meteors, fireworks, and the like. This brief phenomenon defied my logic. It was a light green &quot;fireball&quot; lasting about a second.  It showed a short-persistance trail (1/4-1/2 sec). I&apos;m 5-10 miles north of downtown San Diego.  It was south of my observation point, maybe 30 deg. above horizon.  It faded out at about 15-20 deg.  It may have been visible higher in the sky, but my view was restricted. The object seemed to be falling, moving towards the southwest.  It showed a straight, fast trajectory - like a meteor.  Quite bright but not extremely so. It left me with the distinct impression that it was generated within the atmosphere, that it was not a celestial event.  However, because of its motion and the characteristics of its luminance, it was definitely not fireworks.  It seemed like it could have been only a few thousand feet away.  Seeing a meteor is much different than was seeing this. Interesting too, it occurred right where I was looking, but not expecting anything. Would be interested to know if anybody else saw a similar thing it this time. Email me if you could use or provide further information.  Please keep my last name, address, phone, and email address confidential. Thanks.
19971209	19971210	 Reno, NV	 light	5 Minutes	Summary : Bright red light over Reno, NVThis event was witnessed by many, including the control tower at Reno/Tahoe International Airport who confirmed it was not air traffic. It did not show up on radar. A very bright reddish &quot;light&quot; was observed by me and a friend coming home from work around sunset on Tues, Dec 9. This event was reported by local news throughout the evening and following morning.
19960411	19971229	 Atlantic Ocean,	 light	4 hours	Summary : During a flight from Boston to Amsterdam a strange point of light could be seen for almost the whole flight.When flying from Boston to Amsterdam on a Northwest DC-10, my girfriend and I noticed a strange light off to the lower port side of the airplane at a distance of about 2 to 3 miles.  At first I thought that the light could be a reflection from one of the navigation lights of the DC-10.  After watching the light for about an hour we decided that that wasn&apos;t the case.  It would change position and color.  We could simply tell that it was some sort of object. After a while, we would just take a look out the window every 20 minuets or so. Every time we looked out it was still out there. At one point we asked another passenger and a steward to take a look and they were amazed as well.  The light dissapeared when we started to overfly some shipping, probably about 200 miles from Ireland. After the flight we joked about the &quot;UFO&quot; that we saw, but we were still left with an unsettling feeling. I am a private pilot and I have seen nav light reflections and air traffic at night, this light was not even similar.
19961210	19970514	 Camarillo, CA	 light	3 min.	Summary : I saw a bright, white light moving very fast. It was about, maybe 2 or 3 miles away from me. I saw it outside of my window, and I saw another one, this time, it was red. I took 1 picture of it.I was just getting ready to go to bed, when I saw a bright, white light. I looked outside of my window, and I saw someting moving VERY fast, faster than a jet. A few minutes later, I saw another one. This time, it was red. I took 2 pictures of it, but only 1 came out.  They were roundish in shape, and I was awed by the colors of the objects.
19960828	19970720	 Bothell, WA	 triangle	45 minutes	Summary : Looked out window of my house on a clear night at dusk and saw what looked liked a LARGE Triangular or boomerang type thing appearing like it might land in our pasture or close by and low to ground. I believe it was big enough to cover an acre of land. It had one large middle light like a large bulb in the center and on the outer corners were two small lights. It hovered 45 minutes with no noise whatsoever. I stood outside and watched it for 45 minutes. The most amazing thing was the two lights on each point of this triangle then departed going opposite ways of each other and did some very strange things like loops and things and left the hovering thing there. These two little things that left the large thing were much smaller but they were like points of light. It then formed in a line and flew out towards the mountains but it was very unusual for something to hover for solong but the two points departing was really strange. I phoned this in at the center that night and no ! one has called me back. I can draw it and show you where it was. It was right over our pasture and not that high above ground. I thought at first sight it must be a plane going to land, but planes cannot hover for 45 minutes that I know of and things cannot just depart and :do their own little air show&quot;. I have not forgotten this and may never forget it.

19970419	19970428	 Reno (north of), NV	 other	4 to 5 minutes	Summary : When first seen, it was a huge, brilliant white, &quot;bow-tie&quot; shaped object which exploded into a much larger sphere filled with red, green and white, individual lights.At 1:30 a.m. on April 19th, 1997, I was looking south, towards Reno, from my friend&apos;s kitchen window in her home located in Red Rock Estates about 11 miles north of Reno. I observed a huge, brilliant, &quot;bow-tie&quot; shaped object moving north, toward me, that looked like it was about 20 degrees up from the horizon.  It was too unusual a shape to be a plane or a helicopter and the lights were so brilliant that I stood observing it for 4 to 5 minutes.As it moved over the mountains, it seemed to explode into an enormous sphere of red, green and white individual lights. It stopped moving and seemed to hover above the horizon for 3 to 4 minutes.  Then in seconds, it seemed to twinkle out, first from the bottom of the sphere, finally to the top of the sphere.  Then it was gone.

19940424	19971205	 Albuquerque, NM	 sphere	2-3sec	Summary : I was on my way down from the Sandia Mountain peak (on a tramway) when I saw a bright orange flash and an orange ball of light speed by our tramway.  The speed of the orange ball was so fast that it crossed the entire valley in less than a second.  All I remember seeing was an orange flash in the distant horizon.I am barely reporting this because this is the first time I&apos;ve ever seen this sight.  I have always remembered that night, and I marked it on my calendar because it really made me think and wonder what the hell that thing was.  Anyways, I think I was the only one in the tramway that actually saw the orange ball, but I know that everyone saw the flash. I know this because everyone was asking where the flash came from. Well, I wish I could write more, but I need to be going.  P.S. If you were around back in 94 I was wondering if I could find out if you had any similar reports for that same night
19910612	19971008	 Mifflinville, PA	 light	2 min	Summary : I left work in bloomsburg pa at 700pm heading east on I80 at 710pm about 1/4 of a mile from the bridge that crosses the river i saw a large green light flying above the river when it reached the bridge it made a hard 90 degree turn and went over the mountain staying right above the trees and heading south. thought it was a plane but a plane can not fly above the water cause of the islands in the water. i went home and told my father about it he believed me the next day in the paper it said that some green lights were seen in Washington DC at 715 pm they said that they were meteors well the one i saw was not. the other thing is it was going south in the direction of DC.IN the summer of 91 i was heading home from work.I left work at 700 pm. Traveling east on I80 i started to approach the Mifflinville bridge. At 710 i seen this Large round bright green light flying above the river. i thought it was a plane cause the Bloomsburg airport was near by.

By the time i got to the middle of the bridge the object made a hard 90 degree turn and flew over the mountain right above the trees. now going south. when i went home i told my father about it. he believed me. the next day in the paper was a writing about green lights seen in Washington DC at 715 pm the same night i seen my light. they said that it was a meteor. tell me this how can a meteor fly up a river then make a left turn before hitting a bridge and then fly over a mountain abofe the trees heading south in the direction which DC is in.

19971124	19971124	 Palm Harbor, FL	 triangle	8 minutes	Summary : tracked a triangular object with seven or eight lights hover for approx. 2-3 min. then travel eastward out of view.While driving home, I witnessed a large light low in the sky, which appeared to change color rapidly. It drifted to the west, alternately blinking out and reappearing.  As I parked and got out of my car, it stopped.  I ran inside and got a pair of binoculars (Tasco 7x35mm). When I got back outside, the light was still in the same place.  When I aimed the binoculars at the object, it had three lights on it, two white and one blue. It looked like a helicopter, but I continued to track it as it moved slowly back toward the east. After about two minutes, four or five more lights appeared, two white and the others blinking red, orange, and blue. As it acclerated, I could make out a vague triangular shape which contained the lights. The object took up a good portion of the lenses of the binocs, and with the naked eye was about the size of a dime. There was no discernible sound coming from the object, and the rustling of nearby trees made it hard to tell if there was any noise. The! object continued to accelerate to a speed which made it difficult to track, and disappeared behind the home across the street from mine. Observer info: 21 years old, college student, some knowledge of aircraft, but no non-passenger flying experience.
19971115	19971116	 Reno, NV	 triangle	20 min	Summary : Listened to radio on the way from San Jose to Reno, NV.  We listened to Artbell on his AM talk radio.  We just viewed what we thought were UFOs in the bay area and wondered if there was any news about our sighting.  We heard about the 9 PM Oregon, Washington, and Reno sightings of UFOs and this sort of confirmed our sightings and wondered if they were related.  We kept hearing about triangular shaped objects being sited so we were observing the sky.  The moon was unusually bright that morning.  When I got into Reno, I was headed south on Highway 395 toward our destination and I saw three dots of light that was about 30 degrees from the horizon almost directly toward the south.  The three lights looked like stars but were unusually bright.  I have been star gazing for a couple of years since my wife and I have been interested in UFOs.  I&apos;ve witnessed the landing of the Space Shuttle above the skies in Vallejo.  I also saw the Mir streak across the sky one evening when a local newscaster told me when and where to look for the Mir.  I tried to get a better view and get closer to the lights but the three lights moved toward the west and one of the lights went behind Mount Rose near Lake Tahoe.  We went climbing near Mt Rose about three weeks earlier so we were familiar with locations. The strange thing was the exact symmetry of the three points of light from each other as they slowly moved across the sky.  It seemed like they were guided exactly by the movement of the other lights.  We got out of the car and I took photos and I&apos;m not sure if they will come out.  I should get the photos back on Tuesday.  As my wife and I looked at the two lights as they hovered behind Mt Rose, the right most light flared up in brightness and appeared like it got brighter, then suddenly dimmed.  The lights appeared to me to about 100 miles south west of Reno, somewhere above the Sierras in California.  It could be deceiving and the objects even further out like hundreds of miles.  It is hard to tell unless someone triangulates the movements as I described them.  Now my wife and I and the kids are convinced that we are not alone in this galaxy.  The numerous reports of triangle shaped objects may have merit If I am correct, the object could be miles across and may be cloaked.   The tips of the triangle are the size of stars to throw off our perception and blend in with the stars at night.  Without a telescope, it was difficult to determine if  these were craft that were navigating and controlled by equidistance between each other or one huge vessel. We were excited and contacted the local TV news stations but no one called us back.  You are our only hope to describe this UFO.  Please advise what to do next.I am a Project Manager working for ((Name deleted)) Corp and have a scientific background.  This defies all logic and we are not sure if these were astronomic bodies that we were observing.  My wife and her two sons ((Name deleted)) 12, ((Name deleted)) 9, and my sons ((Name deleted)) 3, and ((Name deleted)) 12 all observed this event and have similar observations.
19861231	19970430	 Mt. Airy (near), NC	 formation	20 seconds	Summary : We were driving south on Hwy. 52 when we saw 3 white lights in a triangular shape ascend from the trees to the left of the highway and hover momentarily before &quot;swirling&quot; out of sight.I was 19 years old and my best friend, also, was 19.  We had just bought a 74 Pinto from a welder on the job we worked at.  We rode home with him and drove the car back from N. of Mount Airy,  NC on Dec 31, 1986.  Andy was driving S. on Hwy. 52 when I saw 3 lights in a triangular formation ascend from the trees on the left side of the highway.  I pointed in amazement at which time Andy hunched over the wheel and saw the lights also.  They were about a hundred yards away and rotating as they ascended.  Andy slowed down and we stared at the lights for about 10 seconds.  The lights then moved rapidly east, kind of swirlinga bit before zipping almost straight up and completely out of sight.  At the rate the lights accelerated, it left us in a total state of shock. Since this occured on New Years Eve, we&apos;ve had a hard time convincing anyone that we really saw it and I never heard of any other sightings.  We used to talk about it a lot but people think we&apos;re crazy and heated arguments would ensue.  What&apos;s confusing to me is that no sonic boom or any kind of noise for that matter was heard or felt.
19970704	19970708	 St. Charles, MO	 light	5 seconds	Summary : We were at a local fireworks display.  Just before dusk, I looked up in the sky with my son and saw a large green object shooting across the sky like a comet, but at a much lower altitiude.  It was just above the clouds and did not have a trajectory of any firework.  It was traveling parallel to the ground from east to west.  Looking up, it traveled from approx. 11 o&apos;clock to 2&apos;oclock and lasted approx. 5 seconds then disappeared.

We always look in the sky when were outside at night and I had just went in the house and sat down at the computer. I didn&apos;t even touch the keyboard when she was hysterically yelling for me to come outside.  I ran outside as quickly as I could because I thought there was something happening to her. She pointed into the sky and told me to look at these lights.  It was clearly obvious that it was a craft of some sort. We could see the area between the lights which had a tiangular shape, was solid and was a different shade (darker) of black than the night sky.  It moved towards Sky Harbor airport as it moved away from us. It made no noise as it went by.We are in the flight path of Sky Harbor and look at the planes as they go over (about 5000 feet).

19950623	19970621	 Buena Park, CA	 light	2-3 minutes	Summary : I was sleeping on the livingroom sofa facing a sliding glass door with a mini-blinds covering the glass when a bright ball of light becomes visable through the blinds and moves slowly back and forth for 2 minutes and streaks off, Later that night a 4 foot humanoid figure&apos;s  shadow is seen through the blinds. I was too afraid to report the sighting untill now.Well I was 10 at the time (young but still sure of what I saw) I am very creitable, was am on the honor roll at Buena Terra School, And am in a gifted and talented class.The object was pure white unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen, their was no noise except a very quiet humming sound it came from the left moved back and forth 3 time probley, and disapeared to the left. It must have been 5 feet off the ground, I have no idea how big it was but I think it might of been in the area of 3-4 feet. The blinds that were covering the glass door were closed so all I could see was the light and almost nothing else. Later that night I was still very shaken up when I saw a humanoid figure, I say humanoid because the head was much too big and it was only  about 4 feet tall, it had a amazingly smoth stride, almost like it was walking on air. I left the mini-blinds closed out of pure fear so all i ever did see were shadows but I know what I saw wasn&apos;t human.I&apos;ve been afraid to report it out of fear my family would think I was nuts, because the next day when I told my family none of them belived me.For this reason I ask that you not call and only contact me be mail or e-mail,((Name deleted))((NUFORC:  Similar incident reported by Cameron, MO, Police Dept. for 21JN95.))
19971114	19971115	 McMinnville, OR	 formation	approx. 10 sec.	Summary : We were out enjoying the full moon.  These things appeared, from over the hills.  I was the first to see them, and it took me about 3 seconds to speak!  I said, &quot;What the hell is THAT?!&quot;  We all stood up to watch.  Then ran over to the crest of the hill to see if we could see them anymore.  It was an incredible sight.  They came from the West and were heading East.  There were 3 at first, then the last (smallest) faded.  They were beautiful!!  We sat there for another hour, dumbfounded; could hardly speak.There were 3, it seemed.  Each had 3, I think, bright white lights in front of them. I think there may have been something in between those 3 lights, but I couldn&apos;t see it clearly.  One of those 3 lights seemed to be a bit bigger and brighter than the other two. They each had these &quot;tails&quot; that were golden, and came out of those front lights like perfect rectangles!  I mean, the tops and bottoms were a perfect straight line, and there was golden glittery stuff in them.  The &quot;glitter&quot; was of different sizes, too.  Not all the same size.  And NO glitter was outside of those rectangles!  They were cruising right along, but not zipping by.  They were absolutely silent.  They followed the contour of the land.  It seemed they were about a mile away from us (very hard to judge), so taking that into consideration, with my hand as a guide, I&apos;d say they were about 6&quot; above the horizon.  The first two were overlapping each other, but the 3rd, and smallest, was behind a bit.  I could se! e it more clearly.  I thought about reporting it, but didn&apos;t know who to call!  Then, as one of the women was driving home, she heard on the radio that there&apos;d been sightings all the way up to Seattle!  The Oregonian tried to say it was &quot;Space Junk&quot;. A rocket!! Ha!  There is NO way that was either one!!  It was incredible.
19971031	19971105	 Nocona, TX	 sphere	12 seconds	Summary : A very dim, round ball of light that moved at a very high speed across the sky--much faster than a jet, but slower than a meteorite.I saw, at midnight, a very dim ball of light.  I call it a ball because it appeared to be a small round object way up in the sky.  It was very dark on this Halloween night, and the sky appeared to be clear as all of the stars were shining.  This small round object glowed very dimly; I could barely see it.  It moved from the north to the south, from horizon to horizon in about 12 seconds, approximately.  I lost sight of the object behind the roof line of my home as it continued south.  This is the first unusual  thing that I have ever seen.  I am 45 years old and I have a BA and a MS degree from TCU in Fort Worth Texas.
19960405	19970516	 Redding, CA	 disk	1 min.	Summary : I saw it hover for a 1min.Then it tuck off at a high speed.It was saucer shape. With two lights on the sides.And a clear canopy.
19960615	19970619	 Eau Claire, WI	 rectangle	7 or 8 sec.	Summary : 2 boys see rectangle shaped object w/4 orange/yelow lights fly silently over head. no blinking beacon lights, no sound, only a few hundred feet overhead. Lights: 1 front, 1 on each side, 1 in back.My neighbor and I were standing half way down my driveway when we saw this object fly overhead due west.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  It didn&apos;t have any blinking beacon lights, and we could not make out shape.  The 4 lights were orange/yellow color, somewhat bright, and and they were positioned in the shape of a diamond around the object.  It was very low, compared to most aircraft that fly, at night, and made no sound.  We viewed it for about a 7 or 8 second duration, in which time it just flew over our heads and over the trees out of our view.  I do not know what the object was,because I figured that if it was airplane flying at night, it would have beacons, which the object i saw did not.  And it went very slow for the altitude it was at, which must not have bee more than a few hundred feet up.  To this day, i have never again seen an air-plane or jet fly at night with no blinking beacons and lights at the head, each wing tip, and tail.
19971128	19971203	 Lake Geneva, WI	 fireball	abt 1 hr	Summary : Follow-up to article in Chicago Sun Times 12/3/97 re &quot;Fireball&quot; in Will Co, Illinois 12/30.  Saw similar in Lake Geneva, WI 11/28/97 around 7:30pm.  Appeared to be an elxposion or electrical fire; presented with a huge red-orange glow that pulsated and flickered, but without sound.  Saw no craft, but noticed three electrical surges during this time period.  No reports of downed aircraft, substation fires or explosions to local authorities.  If you saw any similar display please report it here.After finishing dinner 11/28/97, a friend and I were watching TV in a condo on Lake Como near Lake Geneva Wisconsin.  There were suddenly three power surges/interruptions in rapid succession, but without any sound of explosive nature.  I got up to check out the electrical system, and noticed a huge pulsating red-orange glow to the northeast appearing to be just beyond the tree line near the lake.  However, no sound could be heard only the strange pulsating, flickering red-orange glow.  We went out to the balcony, but could not determine any more about the visualization.  We heard only one distant siren, but observed several autos heading down our cul de sac and on the roads nearby.  So we apparently were not the only ones to see this occurrence.  Since the weather was inclement, we did not got out to pursue this any further.  Unfortunately, we did not report this event to local authorities either.  I have since called the local police, but without any result.  I have contacted the Sun Times reporter in hopes of discussing his article and what we saw.  Possibly there is some reasonable explanation, but it seemed to be very strange and unworld-like!  The sighting in Will Co Illinois on Sunday 11/30 had similar characteristics.  The observer, a local businessman and pilot, reported seeing a brilliant &quot;fireball&quot; about the size of a full moon descend straight down form the clouds at about 125-150mph.  Within 20 seconds it disappeared. Authorities could find no evidence of any downed craft or debris.  Our experience was similar except that we saw no object/craft/etc and the color display lasted for about one hour.  The pulsating/flickering reached intensities that almost totally illuminated the night sky; then suddenly it would stop, start up again, vary in intensity, then flicker and pulsate wildly!  All without any sound!  My first impression was of some sort of electrical fire/explosion, space debris, a meterorite, or possible a UFO!  This event was witnessed by two adult males, approximately 50 years old, ! who had not been drinking, taking drugs, or otherwise mind altered!  One is a business man, the other(myself) a medical professional and student pilot.  This seemed too bizzare an incident not to report to someone; maybe you can shed some light on all this!!

19970313	19970710	 Tempe, AZ	 formation	5 minutes	Summary : I was in tempe with a bunch of my friends when we saw a group of about 5-7 lights in the sky. They seemed to stay in the same place. This was that recent Arizona sighting. But I don&apos;t get why no one mentions the stuff the planes were shooting in the air. They looked like missles, but they didn;t go in one direction. They would descend, go left, bo right, go back up, go down again, and disappear. To me what I thought it was, was the military testing missles. I got seven friends who all saw the same thing. The lights then flew south and disappeared. I submit this so late because I thought it had to be just airplanes because the whole city must have seen it. I was suprised to see this phenThe same thing as up above. All observers are college students at Arizona State

19790715	19970706	 Yakima (30 miles east of, on Highway 24), WA	 other	5 minutes	Summary : Man remembers seeing object with three revolving lights in sky in front of his traveling auto.  Object disappears, car lights go off and on.I need to point out that the following event  was forgotten for several years.  And the other person in the car at the time still doesn&apos;t remember it taking place at all.  But I do remember during a trip from Pasco Washington to Yakima Washington.My friend ((Name deleted))and I were heading to Yakima in order to get another load, I was moving to Pasco.  It was late at night and we were going a little over the speed limit.  When I noticed a object flying in front of me, just off the road.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, then I noted that it wasn&apos;t making any sound and the lights on the aircraft were unconventional in that they rotated around the craft instead of flashing in place.  There were three colors of lights, I remember blue and green with either red or white lights.  They were rotating from my left to my right on the vehicle, which appeared as a dark shadow against the night sky.  The object was within a hundred yards of me and was cigar shaped, roughtly 20 feet wide and 8 feet with no wings or any appendages.  It was flying about 20 feet off the ground  In an attempt to get closer I speeded up to 90 miles an hour and the craft stayed in relative position to me.  Suddenly, the ship instantly speeded off to the nort!h and disappeared over a hill.  It moved with incredible speed.Suddenly my head lights went out.  I took my foot off the gas pedal and started breaking my vehicle.  I pressed the pedal a few times when the headlights came on again.  I was going to excelerate when they went off again.  I continued to break and the lights came on again.  They came on again and I noticed a  field access road off the highway and not wanting to break down on the road turned into it.  ((Name deleted)) and I got out of the car and relieved ourselves by the car.As I said before, I forgot this whole event for a matter of several years.   It was only after a discussion on UFO&apos;s that I remembered the event.  This is the first time that I have reported it to anyone other then close friends and work associates.

19851203	19970527	 Walden, NY	 oval	5 minutes	Summary : A brief account of the sighting that I hadon the evening of Tuesday, 3 December 1985,in Walden, NY.	My one and only sighting occurred on the eveningof Tuesday, 3 December 1985, at approximately 6:15 PMin Walden, a small village about seventy-five miles northof New York City. I had just driven into the parking spacein front of my apartment and had gotten out of the driver&apos;sseat when I looked north and saw a glowing ellipse, justlike the bowl of a street lamp. The ellipse was absolutelyfeatureless and absolutely still, and its bottom thirdportion was hidden by the tops of some nearby houses.Now I had never seen such a light before in that position,nor did I ever see such a light again during the remainingfive years that I lived in the village of Walden. I looked atit with considerable surprise, and I remember sayingto myself, &quot;This must be a UFO&hellip;But I will never see aUFO, so it cannot be one&hellip;&quot; I looked at it for about fiveminutes, and then I went into my apartment. I now realizethat the UFO must have been hovering over the WallkillRiver, midway between Walden and the hamlet of Wallkill,which are about two-and-a-half miles apart on the WallkillRiver.	About 75 minutes later (about 7:30 PM), I waswatching the evening news on television after having eatendinner when I suddenly heard the most deafening soundover the house in which I lived. It sounded like a helicopter,but much louder than any helicopter that I have everheard before or since. The sound was so loud that it wasactually shaking the house. I flew out the door to see whatcould have been causing the sound, and but I could seenothing flying over my house. But at that moment, I knewin my heart that I &lt;had&gt; seen a UFO earlier that eveningand that the sounds that I had heard &lt;must&gt; have beenthe military in camouflaged helicopters in hot pursuit.(Stewart International Airport, by the way, is locatedabout five to seven miles southeast of Walden, and it hasbeen rumored that there is still a military presence on thatinstallation to this day.)	The next day I read in the local newspaper that aUFO has been seen going down the main street of Monticello(about thirty-five miles to the northwest) with police cars inhot pursuit. I have never seen a UFO since, but I am now amember of the UFO research group at Pine Bush.	Thanks for listening to my story. I hope to hearother stories, particularly from those living in the Hudsonand Delaware Valleys of New York State.Regards,Joe QuinnJoequinn@monroe.ny.frontiercomm.net

Both objects would from hovering would dart across the sky and stop for 10 to 20 sec. and take off to a different angle and stop again. Both of the ufo&apos;s played in the sky for around 35 min.. The odd thing was that The ufo&apos;s would dissapear Around 3 min. before a commercial plane would enter the area. The next day in Wendy&apos;s 2 airborne division men in dress came in to eat. There is no air base near by.Around 1:05 am An obgect shoot across the sky and stopped in mid air. Usually there is 4 to 5 guests that hang around but this time there were just my roommate and I. A second object was spotted near by.  The ufo&apos;s from hovering would soot across the sky and stop in mid air. The objects looked like one of the clips from one of the earlier X FILES shows. Where the objects that were a little bigger than stars. would move in many directions and stop. The background was a clear night on the flat lands of Richmond KY . The ufo&apos;s would disappear minutes before a commercial airline would come through the area where they were at an appear later to put on a show again. Finally the ufo&apos;s darted off like a shooting star together to the west and would never appear that night. The next day we were at Wendys and 2 airborne division officers came in looking really tired from the night before. They didn&apos;t speak to each other hardly at all. They did look around the restruant at the people to! see who was observing them. There is no airborne  or base nearby in the area exept for the chemical storage base that has no landing strip that i no of (i&apos;ve have been there).

19950601	19971129	 Methuen, MA	 oval	1 minute	Summary : A large yellow football shaped figure moving rapidly in sky in a horizontal movement. Very large. I saw it for about a minute. There was only one.It was around 8:00pm when I saw a huge football shaped craft flying between a house and some trees. It was bright yellow and moved rapidly in a horizontal motion. There was only one of them and I didn&apos;t see it again for the rest of the night. I was scared to I ran inside. It might of been out for longer, but I only saw it for one mintue or so.
19970606	19970609	 Bothell, WA	 light	about 1 min	Summary : At about 9:45 PM, Friday June 6th, I saw a relatively large round orange/yellow fiery light glide straight across the sky from the NE to the SW. I was looking towards the SE. There was no sound. Several small airplanes also crossed over head that night, and those were quite loud. No light reflected on the low cloud cover, as did the many airplanes I saw that night, indicating it was very low in the sky. One could clearly see the airplanes white, red and blue flashing lights in distinct formation. What I saw actually became obscurred behind the trees in my yard at one point. It appeard to be only about 1 mile away, traveling over Bothell Way!The above description captures most of the information. I wish I had been more conscient of looking at relative surrounds to get a better idea of the objects size. I would say it was close to half the size of a lightbulb at 10 ft from the observer. I was very keen to observe the airplanes that night, to base my observations a the conditions and weather circumstances that night. It proved to me that it was definitely NOT an airplane, It was also not weather related. I do not believe it was an asteroid of some sort. There was no tail that I could see.I have lived in my house, where I observed this, for over 7 years. Occasionally airplanes on the horizon &quot;fool&quot; me into thinking they are not airplanes, when they come straight towards me, and their WHITE light seems unusually bright, and they dont appear to move. However, eventually they change course and I can see their distinctive colored lights and patters. In fact what I saw entered my vision from my left and crossed to my right. It never came straight at me. It&apos;s light was consistent in radiance.My background: I am a 32 year old female, and a graphic designer and artist. I will send you an illustration of what I saw. I may even be able to send you an actual animation, for that is also something I do for a living! I consider myself extremely open-minded to things of this nature, but to this point in my life I have never seen anything like what I saw June 6th! Unfortunately, I was alone and was the only one that saw this from my deck.Julie Brockmeyerjbrockme@adobe.comps, I did call this in Friday night about 9:50pm

These objects were not like the other meteors, they &quot;flew&quot; right to left, up and down before taking off at an extremely high rate of speed before vanishing.Myself -responsible, trustworthy, with no eyesight problems, mental abnormalities, well-liked My Friend-basically the same  Objects sighted-  4, singled colored disk shaped objects, each a different color (red, green, blue +yellow/white) that flew around in no particular formation, then forming a triangle (1 in front and back, two in middle) before taking off at an extremely high rate of speed, faster than any plane I have ever seen go in my lifetime.

THE OBJECT WAS ROUND,AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A BALLOON. IT WAS NOT BRIGHT, IT SEEMED MORE TRANSPARENT OR REFLECTIVE.THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL. THE OBJECT MOVED FROM ALMOST OVER HEAD TO OVER THE HORRIZON OF TREES AND HOMES. THE MOST INTERESTING THING WAS THAT IT MOVED SO QUICKLY. THE SIGHTING LASTED ONLY FOR ABOUT 6 SECONDS.MY NEIGHBOR WAS ALSO OUTSIDE BUT I DIDN&apos;T KNOW IT UNTILL SHE CALLED FOR ONE OF HER KIDS TO GET THEIR DAD. THATS WHEN I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD SEEN IT .

19970712	19970804	 Reno/Sparks, NV	 triangle	about1:30sec	Summary : Large inverted triangle light moved slowly along the flight path of the airport for about a minute then instantly vanished.I was listening to the Art Bell show and had gone to the kitchen to get a glass of water. As I walk past the patio door I look out and saw a inverted triangle of soft golden white light. It was moving at about 60-70mph north along the flight path for Reno Cannon International Airport. At first I thought It was a planes landing lights, but I saw No blinking transponder! I stepped out side and the city was unusually quite. I listened and could hear no engine or jet noise! That is when I knew it was no plane! The flight path Is about 3 miles from my house and I can hear every plane that lands or takes off, and I have watched hundereds of planes take off and land in the 33 years I have lived here. I watched it move from just over the Reno Hilton Hotel, which is about 4-5 miles south west of my house, untill It was just over the dark line of my neighbors house due west off me when it just blinked off! At that distance I would estimate the size to be about 100 by 100 ft. The sides of the triangel were equal and the golden white light was soft enough that the glow did not distort the shape of the object. It was flying level at about a thousand ft. I own a dental laboratory and am use to paying attention to small details. It had travelled about 5 miles from the time I sppotted it untill it vanished about 90 sec. later. It travelled slow and level, it did not turn, pulsate or do any thing unusual except blink off with out even saying goodby. I thought that was very rude. They have the nerve to fly over, get people all excited then leave with out so much as even a thank you.
19970726	19970726	 Arlington, WA	 changing	20 minutes	Summary : At 3:20 a.m. I looked out the peephole in the door, and I saw a white object in the sky outside my house. It changed shapes,ovals, triangles, diamond, and colors, blue, red, white, yellow. It lasted 20 minutes, then disappeared.At 3:20 a.m. I looked out the peephole in the door and saw a light outside. It looked far-away, it had trees in front of it. I had my brother look at it and he thought it was the moon. But I told him to watch it and he said it couldn&apos;t be since it was changing shape and color. I watched it and it kept getting smaller, then larger. When it got small it turned yellow and then it turned really dark outside. When it got big it started changing shapes an and colors, and outside got lit up. Then it disappeared. Then a couple minutes later, it came back and turned into a baseball field shape, there was a blue and red light coming off it. The middle was missing, like a ring. The object was white and lit up. Before it disappeard, it turned into a little tiny dot, then moved up out of my sight and disappeared. It hasn&apos;t been back since.
19970313	19970318	 Chino Valley, AZ	 formation	3 to 5 Minutes	Summary : Observed 5 white lights approaching from thenorth west at what appeared to be a low levelbut rising as they approached.  3 lights infront in a triangular pattern, followed by 2 lights to the rear forming large triangle. Lights went out as passed over. No sound.The lights moved at a relatively slow pace incomparison to commercial jet traffic in thearea and as the lights passed overhead theywent out as though they were all on the fronte dges of the object and were obscured by the object as it passed.  All lights were uniformin size and all appeared white.  Path of travel would seem to be from the area of Kingman, Arizona passing just west of Chino Valley and on toward Prescott Valley.  Path would be slightly north and east of the Prescott airport &quot;Love Field&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a time of &quot;11:33,&quot; but does not specify whether am or pm.

19970502	19970503	 Oceanside, CA	 other	10 minutes	Summary : What appeared to be a slow-burning, orange-colored object was slowly &quot;floating&quot; in a northernly direction directly over the beach just south of the city boat harbor. Six of us noticed it from a balcony at a party. I am a working daily journalist. With me were two Oceanside city council members. This object &quot;floated&quot; north for about two or three minutes, then stopped. After about a minute or so, it began moving back south-southwest over the water. Altitude was hard to determine, but it appeared to be climbing, albeit ever-so slowly. At one point, a small &quot;spark&quot; like object slowly fell from the main object. Through biconculars I was able to see four (4) distinct lights in a diamond shape. This object slowly faded from sight directly above our city&apos;s Pier. I honestly thought it was a balloon someone had set afire and let drift, but it wouldn&apos;t have burned that long and, because of our off-shore breeze, which was slight that night blowing inland, no balloon would have drifted p!arallel against the wind, then reverse course. Yes, we were at a party. No, no one was drunk. In fact, at least two of the people had nothing to drink.One object.Orange (as in fire) in color.At first appeared to be burning.Binocs revealed four (4) distinct lights.Object &quot;floated&quot; slowly at about a speed of 20 to 40 knots in a northernly direction over the California coastline near the city harbor of Oceanside.Speed was tough to determine because altitude appeared to be at about 500 to 600 feet. But the longer watched, the more it seemed to be gaining in altitude.Altitude: 500 to 600 feet.A second object &quot;drifted&quot; off to the southeast for about what seemed to be a short distance, as if it were a spark falling away, but then it seemed to hover in mid-air.Observers:1.

19970704	19970705	 McMinnville, OR	 disk	50 sec.	Summary : I was watching fire works with binoculars, and I saw something weird. As I watched it, I ruled out the possibility of a plane or fire work.Well, I was standing outside watching the firecrackers go off through binoculars, when i noticed something in the air. I focused in on it, and i saw that it wasn&apos;t a plane. it had red/orange lights on it, and around it. it was just kind of hovering, not moving like you see a plane. Then I lost site of it. I scanned the sky, and found it. It had shooted up at a very fast speed, and at a really steep angle. Now it was hovering over a field. I went inside to get my camera, and when i came back outside, it was gone. It never appeared again. Also, this has nothing to do with it, but a picture taked in the 50&apos;s of a UFO, well the people are my neighbors! The thing I saw was disked shaped, and it slopped up on the sides to form almost a triangle shape.

As we kept getting closer and closer to it, the object remained in the same place.  It did not move at all.  There were no lights.  We drove towards it for at least 45 minutes.  It got dark and we lost visual contact.

19740715	19970722	 Hampton (Virgina Beach amusment park), VA	 light	5 seconds	Summary : Bright ball. Moved from N to S. Reported next day up and down the Eastern seaboard.I was taking photos in the park and someone said &quot;why don&apos;t you photograph that looked up and saw a bright ball moving from north to south was so surprised I didn&apos;t take a picture. The siting was reported the next day as having been seen from New York to Florida. This was not a military operation. News reports said no military contacted knew anything about it. This was a long time ago, but I can still see the image as it occurred in my mind.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))
19640515	19970508	 Texarkana (outside city limits), AR	 disk	05 min	Summary : Saw very large flying object resting on ground on country road in middle of clear day.Observer background:  US Army Officer (retired), Top Secret background investigation, executive and software engineer for fortune 10 corporation.  This is something I have needed to talk about for a long time.  The event happened as follows: Clear spring day me and friend working on car  (no drugs or acho involved) and I broke a spark plug.  We had to go into town (approx 7 miles away).  I lived out in a very unpopulated area next to a Boy Scout Wilderness Camp.  Houses are several miles apart.  On the way into town about a mile and a half from my house I turn right to take the road to the Hiway into town and there sitting on the left side of the road, a road I drove at least twice a day for the past several years was a UFO.  We pulled up alongside and stopped, it was huge.  70-90 feet across 25-35 high.  Color:  dark gray, not shiny but almost a dull or parkerized type finish, smooth but not shiny smooth.  Typical of a nitrided or titaimum applied finished metal.  Shape.  Clearly saucer like with rounded edges and viewing ports (round) at the top.  Lite smoke or steam from the grass was drifting up around the UFO.  The UFO seemed to be bathed in a glow, even tho this was around noon on a clear day.  The glow was almost ultraviolet, it seemed to be glowing around the edges.  We stopped and looked at it, it being about 30 feet from the truck, then we &quot;got the hell out of there&quot;.  We went down the road for about 3/4 of a mile then we went back and it was gone.  We got out and there was nothing but a large depression in the grass where it had set and the ground was warm to the touch.  As the days went by, I noticed the grass died in a large round area where the UFO had sat down.I have thought of this many times since 1964 and every once in a great while I see the guy who was with me, we have never talked about this to anyone since it happened.  But I feel its time to tell what I saw!
19970704	19970708	 Granite City (5min.from St.Louis,MO.), IL	 light	3to4sec.	Summary : A blue-green light moved so fast across the sky I had to turn my head to keep up with it.On 7/4/97 after lighting off or last fireworks as our last bit of ash fell,another witness and myself saw a blue-green lite move across a large field of view in the sky then disappeard at impossiable speed!!    The lite was Tri-shaped with the brightess part beeing the top and bottom. It appeard as if it was sitting with the lights off then turned them on and moved at the same time. It was under the clouds because the lite from it reflected off the clouds like lighting does. It then move so fast in my field of view I had to turn my head to keep up with it.  It wasn&apos;t moving downward or upward it looked as if it was moving straight across the sky. We ran in to tell my girlfriend and our friend and they were like it&apos;s the 4th of July,It was prob. a rocket.. I said No way, then on Tues.7/8/97(today) the friend who didn&apos;t believe said she heard about it on the radio this morning that other people saw it..  It&apos;s been on the news and someone has a video tape of it that they played. They reported that as many as 200 people called in to report it..   my name is ((name deleted)) I&apos;m 21years old. The other witness was a 14 year old boy named ((name deleted)), another person was outside at the time and they just happend to be looking down and missed it..  I still get goose bumbs,It was amazing!!~~
19940515	19970310	 Fallon, NV	 light	45 seconds	Summary : USN trained weather observer sighted 3 &quot;solid&quot; colored lights, two red, one white, moving south to north silently and periodically&quot;rocketing&quot; forward at a tremendous burst of speed, independently and in unison.While on active duty and attached to NAS Fallon, NV, I witnessed 3 strange lights cross the field during the spring of 94&apos;. I don&apos;t remember the exact date but I do remember the day and time. It was a Saturday evening minutes after 18:00, the field had just closed. I stepped outside of the &quot;old&quot; tower, which houses the weather office and flight filing services,to observe the twilight. It was very quiet as was typical for a Saturday evening after the field closes, no planes, no engines, no cars, you could hear a pin drop (almost). I was facing east looking at the mountains which are about 35 miles away. The objects or lights caught my eye to the south and I turned my head to view them. I saw three &quot;solid&quot; coloredlights traveling abreast, moving north, at a relatively high rate of speed, they appeared to be about 2500&apos; AGL and about 10 miles south. The two on the outside were red and the one in the middle was white (unfourtunately I am colored blind and cannot be 100% sure of the colors but two were definately dark and one was light). The objects wers solid coloredand appeared to be &quot;lit&quot; or illuminated rather than reflected light. I observed no strobes or marker lights of the kind you would expect to see on conventional aircraft and they were silent. I could not discern any particular shape or other features of any kind, they just appeared to be circular or oval.  About ten seconds into the sighting the red or &quot;outside&quot;objects seemed to jet or rocket forward at a tremendous rate of speed for 3-4 seconds then, just as abrubtly, resume their previous rate of speed. At the same instant that the red ones slowed down the white one, which had been in the center duplicated the maneuver, catching up and resuming it&apos;s previous position in the center.  This happened two more timesand by this time the craft were to my north and heading out of site. When they were abreast or directly to my east, they seemed to be about 5-7 miles away. At this particular site you can see about 75 miles to the south and about 100 miles to the north. The three things that struck me as strange were 1)The solid colored lighting with no detectable conventionalmarkings or lighting. 2)The strange and abrubt maneuvering. 3) The sound, there wasn&apos;t any. At the time I was a USN trained weather observer/forecaster with 10 years of experience. I had been working at this particular location for a little over two years and was used to identifing military and commercial aircraft of all types. I later asked a local resident, aformer WWII Army Air Corp veteran who still flew privately, if he had ever seen anything unusual in this area. He said yes but would not elaborate. I&apos;ve thought that maybe they were something from Dreamland or Area 51, which is reportedly just to the south of this location, approximately halfway to Nellis AFB. But who knows, I may have imagined the whole thing.

19960715	19970713	 Kalamazoo, MI	 other	1 mimute	Summary : In the summer of 1996 my friend and I saw a bright object traveling across the sky very quickly making unusually strange movements, strange jigs, and path alterations although maintaining a rather straight path from North by northwest to south by southeast.  It covered the complete sky at a speed slightly slower than a falling star.. but this was not a falling star.My friend and I were floating on rafts on Pickeral lake not too far from Sprinkle Road and Kilgore.. by a Winery in Climax Scotts.  We were just relaxing on the lake, it was quiet on the lake and were were anckored down so we wouldn&apos;t move.  The night was slightly chilly so we didn&apos;t go swimming like usual, but the stars were very clear, and everything was rather calm.  I saw something moving very fast across the sky at first I thought it was a shooting star because I have seen a number of them at that lake, but this did not dissipate like meteors do.  Then I noticed that it was making strange and sharp turns and jumps side to side, I alerted my friend who then quickly picked up on the sight.  He saw the strange jigs and jumps it was making and the speed at which it was traveling.  We were both amazed because we had never seen anything like that before.  We have told a couple of people but most just say &quot;Oh.. that&apos;s nice.&quot;
19540601	19970705	 Fish Canyon, CA	 light	1 minute	Summary : Helix flight pattern at zenithI think it was 1954 - Summer - camping with the Boy Scouts. I saw an object very high up and near the zenith which was a point of light which performed a helix flight pattern (approximately west to east). It was only visible across a restricted arc of the sky in spite of no celestial or terrestrial obstructions.
19970714	19970715	 Salem, OR	 light	3-6 minutes	Summary : AT FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE BUT OBSERVING THROUGH BINOCULARS, SAW ONE VERY BRIGHT LIGHT AND 3 SMALLER ONES... THEY WERE NOT BLINKING.WENT INTO THE BACK YARD TO CHECK ON THE CATS ABOUT 1:30 AM AND WAS DOING A LITTLE STAR GAZING WHILE I WAS AT IT.. ABOUT 1:35-1:40 I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINGLE VERT BRIGHT&apos; LIGHT COMING FROM ALMOST DUE NORTH, BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN SIGHTLY NORTH-EAST.. ANYWAY IT SO BRIGHT AND NOT MAKING ANY NOISE I RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT THE BINOCULARS AND WAS ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE LIGHT AND SAW IT HAD 3 SMALLER LIGHTS BEHIND IT. TWO SMALL WHITE ONES AND A SINGLE BLUISH-GREEN ONE.. NO RED OR STROBE LIGHTS LIKE AIRCRAFT THAT FLY OVER ALL THE TIME. MY FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS A SATELLITE AS IT WAS MOVING SO FAST AND QUIET BUT IT WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH AND WAS TOO BRIGHT. IT WAS ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THE EVENING STAR...I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND IT WAS STILL BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE IT WITH THE NAKED EYE.. I MADE THE COMMENT TO MYSELF, AS IT WAS ABOUT GONE FROM SIGHT, &quot;IT MUST BE OVER EUGENE BY NOW&quot; NOTE, EUGENE IS ABOUT 72 MILES SOUTH OF SALEM.

19970311	19970312	 Charleston, WV	 sphere	15 minutes	Summary : 3 bright,orange objects with comet-like tails, moving toward earth, then toward each other, then horizontally, east to s.westMy 9 year old daughter and I were in the car and both saw an orange, bright object which appeared to be falling to earth.  It had a tail above it. Then 2 other objects appeared moving toward the first one. They all had vapor trails, or tails.  Then, they all three changed course, moving together horizontal to the earth, from our left to right.  They stopped at one point and appeared to hang in the sky.  We had parked the car to look and I measured one of the objects against a tree limb, and it did not move for some minutes.  Gradually, they grew smaller as they moved away, but the orange color was clearly visible until they disappeared behind a mountain.      The conditions:  it was aclear evening, at sunset.  The moon was visiblea bove the objects in the sky.  No rain, or clouds at all, but no stars were yet visible.It grew completely dark in the time we watched them.   I am a lawyer and my daughter is in 4th grade. Neither of us has ever seen anything similar to this before.   Interestingly,by the time we reached our home, 4 military planes from the National Guard flew over usheading southwest, which is the direction the three objects had been heading.
19970704	19970708	 Granite City, IL	 light	15 minutes	Summary : Fourth of july celebration.We was watching the firework celebration, approx. 21:15. A few mminutes into the event, a blueish green light come from the east to the west. Looks like it wasn&apos;t much higher than the big aireal display. It flew almost into the fireworks and was gone, we only seen it for about a second or two. it was pretty neat. I imagine alot more people there saw it but I dont know. Thank you.

19970612	19970616	 Newark (south of, Garden State Pkwy.), NJ	 light	5 seconds	Summary : A bright light with a tail, like a fireworks, flew east to west across the highway, between 100 and 500 feet elevation??, distance ??This appeared to be single fireworks rocket, but it travelled horizontally. My wife and both children saw it. It lasted just a few seconds. The fact that it was traveling horizontally was what made it unusual. It&apos;s height and distance were difficult to judge, but I would guess that it was no more than 2 miles away, between 100 and 500 feet elevation. The light was yellow, it did not appear very large. The tail was yellow and white.
19970812	19970813	 Canyon Country, CA	 light	about 1 minute	Summary : Two adults witness three dim yellow lights flying in rough triangle formation, moving from north to south.  The three lights jockey for position, speeding ahead, falling behind, and crossing over each other.My husband and I are working artists in the fields of traditional and computer animation. While meteor-watching in our backyard on the evening of Aug 12 he spotted three small lights moving just below the pole star.  I saw them, then, and we both watched as they moved, a little faster than a commercial aircraft, from north to south, where they disappeared from sight behind the hills.  The lights began in a rough line, from top to bottom, with the middle light slightly ahead of the others. As they crossed the sky, one would speed ahead, then fall behind as another sped ahead, and at intervals one would cross over another in almost a playful manner. The impression I received at first was that of a three-cornered object tumbling, but when the lights passed in front of stars it was clear they were distinct from one another and not part of a larger solid object, as the stars were clearly visible between the lights. The lights were about the brighness of the dimmest of the stars visible, and a warm yellow color. This same night we had observed several meteors and several commercial aircraft. These lights were at a lower altitude and exhibited vastly different behavior than the commercial craft we saw, and were definitely not meteorites, as they were neither bright nor fast enough and left no trails.

Thinking it was my landlord plowing the field Istepped out my back door .  I observed 3 objects moving at walking speed 25 ft. off ground travelling west. I waved at them and they stopped. I called my wife out and waved for them to set down. I told my wife &quot;I&apos;m going to run out to them.&quot;I heard-saw in my mind &quot;DANGER&lt;DONOT APPROACH THE CRAFT&quot;. My wife grabbed my arm (leaving fingerbruises) and yelled NO!  The 3 craft were 90 ft. tall 2 blue pyramids pointing into a red ball, vertically aligned ,spinning very fast shutting white shafts of light out bottom. They stopped for 2 min.s  me yelling &quot;setdown&quot; and &quot;we&apos;re friendly&quot;.  After that they moved offwest following the Co. line for a mile or two and then turned south remaining in triangle formation in perspective to us. On this south bound leg they stopped after 200 Yd.s , the bottom 2 traveled up and the top 1 hooked down and under in a&quot;J&quot;. They reversed this maneuver and returned to original formation. they then did a startrek blur south very, very fast ! The night got stranger after that, but these are the basic facts of the sighting.

19841107	19970716	 Carrollton (6 miles west of, on Garrett Circle), GA	 other	10-12 minutes	Summary : For 10 minutes, moving from north to south 25 feet above the ground, moving at 1 to 2 miles an hour, a 150 ft tall, 30 ft wide vertically fying object marked by blind white lights, but no surface illumination of the craft flew over our house at 364 Garrett Circle.  It vaguely had the shape of a giant iol rig, but had no clearly discernible surface despite the arc-bright lights.  A deafening sound of an electric generator, at possibly 90 decibels, with extreme low bass wave undertones was heard, but no down drafts, wind, jet blast or discernable means of levitation (moving wind) was observThe 150 ft tall, 30 ft wide craft, vaguely resembling an extremely brightly lit, vertically flying oil rig or wide-width broad cast tower, flew over our house at 364 Garret Circle, at 2:30 Am Nov 7, 1984, 6 miles west of Carrollton, Georgia. Initially the object rose up from a forest 100 yeards to the north of our house, and was spinning head over heels vertically in the air, making deafening rumbling and electrical generator sounds.  It was the deafening waves of sound and the bright lights that woke both me and my wife up.  I am a fairly prominent political scientist in my field, a two-time Fulbright scholar, a Ph.D. with long interests in astronomy, and my wife has a Masters in public administration.  I am a Scout leader, and a responsible college administrator now (1997).  My wife and I instantly woke up, flew to the front yard ard, and observed the craft cease spinning and it floated towards us 25 to 30 feet above the ground in a VERTICAL flying position.  You must imagine it is unreasonable to think that aerodynamics allow such a huge object to fly without wings, moving air, jet-blast, or any discernible means of propulsion, to fly vertically in position, but move horizontally at 1 to 2 miles an hour.  We watched for 10 to 12 minutes as the craft approached, passed over our pecan tree and house, clearing it by 8 to 10 feet, and floating south-southwest, it slowly disappeared over the horizon.  The craft was followed within about 100 ft by two approx 10 to 15 ft in diameter, red translucent and free-floating globes.  The large craft had immensely bright lights (as bright as an arc welders light), none of which were directional. The craft passed slowly over our front yard, from the forest across the street north, above our pecan tree, and our one story home, passing approximately 1 to 15 ft above the! house.  I could walk along with the craft across our yard slowly and keep up with it, until I hit our back fence line 70 yards behind the house.  I could easily see for several minutes the craft from no more than 20 feet below it.  As hard as I tried, I could not see past the bright lights to a surface of the craft.  This was extremely weird, since a street light illuminates the surface of it&apos;s pole, but these immensely bright lights would not illuminate the surface of the craft, which appeared as black mat invisible.  The lights were randomly distributed, with maybe 3 dozen lights, 5% red-colored.  I stress that the craft had NO WIND DRAFTS,  no down drafts, no jet stream or sound, no discernible flying mechanism -- just a 90 decibel level sound of electric whine as with a giant generator, and waves and waves of deep bass undertones.  The translucent globes had no discernible content inside, and were randomly floating behind the large craft, following it but not gaining on i! t, nor attached to each other or the large craft in any way.  They floated like directionally motivated soap bubbles, following the craft.  The craft was so near me I could have lobbed an apple upwards with a hand and hit it.  I recall being extremely intense about observing the environment, watching how the craft flew almost over our pecan tree, and cast moving shadows through it but did not disturb its branches in any way -- all to verify the physical reality of the observation.  My wife observed it with me, but for 1 minute moved into the house to flash lights from the porches at it to see if it would respond, to no avail.  She immediately came back out to observe it with me again as we moved to the backyard.  We kept confirming to each other we were awake verbally, but we agreed not to describe it to each other until we independently wrote a description up, with drawings -- without conversation -- and traded the descriptions to check each others observations.  The only dis! crepancy I can remember in our descriptions is that she thought there were a different number of red globes than I (I remember two, I think she recalled three, or one, but not two).  We were up discussing our reports to each other until one half hour later, we heard the drone of helicopter and airplan engines outside.  We went outside and coul clearly see that 1/2 mile to the east two black and low-flying military tyope helicopters, with forward looking light beams, were accompanying a low- and slow flying two engine plane.  They circled around our territory in a radius of about 1 mile, and criss-crossed once going from north to south and followed the trajectory of the crafts which had vanished.  We advertised in the Carrollton paper about a week later for other potential observers, but got no takers.  We interviewed neighbors, one of which was a pilot immediately to the north of us, but noone reported any perceptions or sightings.  We called the local sherrif&apos;s office, and th! e Carrollton police that morning to ask if anyone reported anything to them, and they said no reports were turned in.  At one point we gave an interview to someone who may have been connected to Mufon -- at least he was a friend of a friend who said he had connections with some reporting organization, but we never heard anything back from him.  We possibly could trace back who that person was, as he was a son of an elderly woman in our faith, who is now deceased.  We simply had NOONE to report the information to in those days of no internet or organized reporting networks.  I have read sporadically in the UFO literature, but have never run across a similar description.  I would be grateful to know of similar descriptions in a sighting.  The only ones that vaguely resemble ours are two reports in Alien Update by Tim Good by two UK couples in the early 1990s, but their sighting was of an orange colored rectangular (vertical) craft, and the description was not too close, or clear! ly written.  That night was slightly hazy if I remember correctly, with no winds.  We aver very curious to this day as to the purpose behind the military recon helicopters and plane.  I would like to request public anonymity, but I would talk to a researcher, as I am sure my wife would.  I attempted to use a camera, but I had no film in it at the time, to my regret. ((Name and number deleted)).  Sincere thanks.  Again, I WILL talk to a researcher, but I&apos;d prefer at this time that my name not be used, until I am convinced of the credentials of a researcher.

19960401	19971202	 Mason, MI	 unknown		Summary : &quot;Alien&quot; body, decomposing, with silvery skin, approx 36&quot; - 48&quot; tall was found by Mason residents under leaves in their yard.The Lansing State Journal aalong with WILX and WLNS television stations, both in Lansing, initially reported that residents of Mason, MI uncovered a strange humanoid like body on their property as they raked leaves in the spring months of 1996.  The body was slender with long arms and legs, a small head and to the best of my recall, large eyes.  The body was reported to be 3.5 to 4 feet in lenght with silver skin that was deteriorating (presumably over the winter).  The news sources reported that the remains had been taken to Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mi,for examination.  Suspiciously, there was never again any mention of this unusual find in the newspaper, on TV or over the radio.  It would seem that the media was instructed to drop the story, even though it was one having great public appeal and would draw large audiences.  This certainly seems to have been a &quot;hush&quot; job.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  If anyone has follow-up information about this alleged report and incident, we would be grateful for any further facts about the case.  PD))
19800601	19970327	 Greeneville, TN	 triangle	30 seconds	Summary : 3 witnesses see 2 large triangular objects hovering about 100 feet in air. No sound. Objects shoot laser beam toward one another-disappearwith loud boom.In spring or summer of 1980, mysister, cousin and I were on my grandmothers front porch, sitting on her swing. Across from her homewas a very large, empty field.Suddenly, the three of us lookedup to find two large, silvery,triangular shaped objects withlights along all sides. Theobjects were about 100 feet or soabove us, over the field.They wereclose enough that we could seedetails on the craft. The two objects hovered silently for about30 seconds, then something verystrange happened. Each of theobjects shot a laser beam out the&quot;front&quot; towards one another. (theywere &quot;facing&quot; each other) Just asthe two laser beams touched, the objects disappeared with a very loud boom! This event was sounusual, that I&apos;ve thought about it every day since then.
19970417	19970418	 Bismarck/Caddo Valley (between), AR	 light	30 seconds	Summary : Orange burst of light that sped out over the lakeMy 16 year old daughter and I were going to the convenience store in Caddo Valley from our home in Bismarck.We were on Highway 7 crossing the large dyke on DeGray Lake, I saw form the corner of my eye a burst of bright orange light that was at the level of the passenger side window(the road that crosses the dyke s approximately 20 feet above water level.  My daughter asked if I had seen the orange object.  I told her that I had seen justa burst of orange light, and she stated that she had seen the light burst, and then saw it speed off down thelake.  She said that it was definitly above the water, because she saw its entire reflection on the water.  She also stated that she watched it for a very short period of time (approximately 30 seconds) and that it simply disappeared as it travelled toward the Caddo Drive area of the lake. She also said that she thought that it mighthave come up from behind us because it appeared to come from that direction, and that she had gotten a &quot;cold chill&quot;before she saw the object.  There were no other cars on the dyke at the time, but one car was headed up Big Hill onthe Clark County side of the dyke at the time that it happened.
19971018	19971025	 Evansville, IN	 unknown	about 1 min.	Summary : Daughter &amp; I were fishing and when we heard &amp; saw a plane I said &quot;look honey, see the plane!&quot; At that time somethuing appeared just behind the plane, yet lowere than the plane was.  Luckily I had my video camera and caught it on tape!  You tell me what it was it definately wasn&apos;t a plane. Not a plane I&apos;ve ever seen anyway! Can You tell me who might be interested in purchasing this video footage.  You can tell by my daughter this was a weird mishalf, it even frightened her! I had a camera in one hand, fishin pole in the other and 6 year old daughter holding on tight to my left leg! spotted a UnidentifiedI will send a COPY of this Video Tape provided I have assurance it will not be duplicated, and not used for any nature other than to check its authenticity.  This includes scientific research!  They can afford to pay this poor old Evansville Boy something for this footage.  After watching the video in slow-motion it appears to manuver in an odd fashion.  Directly after my daughter saying it might be another plane, I say it might be a UFO. Still pause tape there; run the tape in slow-mo and watch what you see! Is that strange or what? I don&apos;t know of any planes moving like that. Hell, there isn&apos;t even a Airforce Base anywhere that close! This was on a bright, clear sunshiney day! My daughter explains what shape she thought it looked like at the end. I will send the tape upon verification to use only as directed.

19970313	19970318	 Prescott, AZ	 formation	5 min	Summary : v formation white lights to start with at long range as it got closer looking through binoculars each light was actually 2 one red one green 4 on one side 3 on the other like missing man formation moving very slow and making no noise at all.At around 8:15 on 03/13/97 four of us observed a v shaped object coming at us with bright lights. As it got closer we got out some binoculars and looked at it, what looked like white lights were actually two lights forming one. One light being green the other one was red. During this time the oddest thing about this, was there was no noise at all. There was no moon to backlight this so we could only see the lights. I thought perhaps because there was no noise that it might have been a pedal plane that I saw on the discovery channel once. It appeared to be about 1000 feet in the air. One observer is a principal at a local gradeschool, another telephone man, one dental asst., and a 14 year old.
19560715	19970704	 Yellowstone Park (near South entrance), WY	 disk	60 sec	Summary : Three year old boy witnesses from back the seat of a car the approach of three flying disks.I am sending this because I your site I found out that there was a UFO flap in 1956.  Until today I was unaware of this.In the summer of 1956 my parents and I lived in Wyoming.  They decided to go to Yellowstone and it was there that I saw what I am telling you now.  Even though I was three I recall much about the trip because Yellowstone was such a special place.  I think my parents were probably very impressed so it stuck in my mind.  Anyway we had spent the night parked along the road, not in a camp ground or in a cabin.  My mother recalled that it had been a very spooky night, very dark.  As we left the park the next day we traveled south along a narrow highway.  We were in a black Hudson, and I was laying in the back window-well (it was my favorite place to ride on long trips).  As I looked up at the sky and trees I saw three objects coming up from behind us about 100 feet above us.  They followed behind the car staying in between the trees that lined both sides of the road.  I remember I had seen them as we were coming around a curve.  They looked like metal painted orange with yellow rib!s on their undersides.  Each was a disk about 20 feet wide and on top was a dome with a large glass or window.  In each was a human like figure.  One disk pulled away while the other two closed in on the car dropping to about 30 feet altitude.  The disk nearest the car tilted downwards at an angle so that I could see the pilot clearly.  In my three year old memories I recall thinking of the pilot in the lead craft as a HELICOPTER PILOT wearing dark sun-glasses.  My family at that time was too poor to go to movies and we did not own a TV, so the only thing I could relate the objects to were helicopters.  I waved at the pilot and he held up his left hand palm facing me and waved his hand kind of slowly back and forth.  I jumped down into the back seat and leaned over to tell my parents that there were HELICOPTERS behind us.  They looked out the windows but the objects were gone.  All I recall is that they didn&apos;t really question me about it much and dropped it.  This memory alway!s stayed with me and was never forgotten.  I didn&apos;t dwell on it but every time I saw our Yellowstone pictures or recalled the trip I also recalled the 3 crafts.  However it wasn&apos;t until I was about 10 that it suddenly dawned on me (being older and wiser) THOSE WERE NOT HELICOPTERS!  DO you know it was not until last year (1996) that it suddenly dawned on me that those guys might not have been wearing sunglasses.  Last year I did a little study and began to notice that appearances of 3 saucers with the outlines I had seen also seemed to turn up in other areas.  But there is more to my story.  neither of my parents recalled the incident (which seems normal since at the time I had told them it was helicopters and hence it wouldn&apos;t have been something to stick in their memory for several years.  Note: in about 1989 my mother called me in a panic one day to tell me a dream she&apos;d had (my mother almost never recalled dreams and claimed she never dreamed).  She told me that she had dr!eamed that a UFO was over her house and that beings were coming into her bedroom and surrounding her.  But she said she woke up to hear a real noise over her house: it was a National Guard helicopter (there was a helicopter training base north of town: Norman Okla.).  What I wondered about was the connection of the helicopter noise to the intense UFO dream she was having.

It lit up the entire sky.  It was a teardrop shape and it disapeared after about 3 seconds.  I dont know how many people saw it but there were other reports in nearby towns this weekend and others have video tape of the sightings.
19970814	19971207	 Norco (River and Trail), CA	 disk	45 sec	Summary : I observed a shinny mettalic Disk Flying,  across the clear blue sky.Weather was very clear, I was taking my two children swiming and noticed a classic looking round shinny disk moving across the sky. I then asked my kids to tell me what they could see in the sky and my 9 yr old daughter replied &quot;looks like a fling dish dad&quot;, my 6 yr old then said &quot;yes dad looks like a shinny plate.&quot; the object was traveling from north west to the south east over the Ontario, California area. A few minutes later a small cessna, flew  nearly the same distance and path as the object. The object I would estimate traveled at 3 times the speed of the plane. ???
0000	19971004	 Spartanburg, SC	 light	15 min	Summary : bright orange round object first thought to be rising full moonwhile on a night fishing trip in the summer of 1966, a friend and i saw what we thought to be the moon rising from behind a house on a hill across the lake from us. it was so big and orange that we talked about it and watched as it rose . but , then we noticed it was moving a bit faster than the moon should have been. it came up into full view and pass over a house sitting on a hill . it was now in full view and moving across the lake at about 400 to 500 feet above the water. we now knew it wasn&apos;t the moon and became afraid . we started packing our fishing gear and started to leave. we still watched the object as it moved slowly across the lake and turned as if to move to the lake.as we were leaving we heard what sounded like trees falling in the distance. we didn&apos;t hang around to see what was going on. the object was a large , round , dish , and was as bright orange as a rising new moon.it was about the size of a med. size house and made no sound at all. i have only told a few close friends about this, but as i get older ( i will be 50 in Nov. 97 ) i think about what we saw and think i should let others know. i know what i saw was real , but can&apos;t understand why everyone sees something different.
19970704	19970714	 Plymouth, WI	 light	45 minutes	Summary : Large v-shaped lights over fireworks display. Very high up.Sat still for 40 min. Began to move slow for 1 min., then streaked away VERY fast.I am a housewife and the mother of five. My ten year old son and I were at the fireworks display at the park in Plymouth WI. Before the display began we noticed that directly above our heads was an object. My son first saw it and commented that it looked like an arrow. The light were white with a very slight blue tinge compare to the brught planets. The object was about five to eight times brighter than a planet that was also visible. It stayed stationary for a long period of time, about 20 minutes later I saw a second obect, same shape but appeared to be father away,maybe 3 times brighter than the planet.I wasn&apos;t constantly watching,but I know that by ten o&apos;clock the 2nd object was gone. There was a large group of people sitting 10 feet in front of us and I know they saw it to because we could hear them talk about it, wondering what it was.As the grand finale started[fireworks] I saw that it was slowly moving from north to south . Then after a little while it moved fery fast sort of arcing to the south and it was gone. This was during the last few fireworks. Do you suppose they&apos;re watching fireworks? Do you think they were our own experimental aircraft?
19780801	19970420	 Dundee (5 miles east of), FL	 sphere	20-30 seconds	Summary : My sister and I were takeing the garbage cansup the driveway one summer night.  Three white glowing ojects in triangular formation flew overus.  Their angular size was slightly larger thanan US quarter held at arm&apos;s length.It should be noted that the date I gave above could be up to 2 months inaccurate since it wasquite a while ago.I am presently a mechanical engineering student.So far I haven&apos;t come across anything in my studies which would explain what I saw, except the slight posibility of ball lightening.I first spotted the objects when they were approximately35 degrees above the southwestern horizon.  The flew nearly overhead toward the northeast.  They had an angular sizesomewhat larger than a quarter, there was no wayto tell the actual size.  I got the impression that they were distant because I couldn&apos;t discern any surface details.Their shape was most likely spherical, since the shape of their profile remained roughly spherical for the duration of the time I saw it.There were three of them, each on the vertex of anequilateral triangle with sides about twice as longas the diameter of the objects.  They glowed almostpure white with just a touch of bluish-purple.  Theymade a soft very high pitched sound like anultrasonic cleaner used for cleaning draftingpens.  I didn&apos;t notice any thermal radiation.Our horses which were in the front pasture werespooked by them as were my sister and I. (I wasabout 10 or 11 and my sister 4 years younger)I was facinated by them, but frightened to thepoint that I couldn&apos;t move for about 20 seconds.When I did move I ran home.If I had to guess their actual size, I&apos;d saythey were 20 to 50 meters in diameter.  Theiris the possibility that they exerted a force onme, but that was most likely my stomach jumpingin excitement.If I have the time and skill, I&apos;ll try to emaila drawing of what I saw.
19970621	19970624	 Fort Collins, CO	 disk	7-9 sec	Summary : My wife and I have had another sighting.  Sunday night (6/21/97) at 11:15 PM we were in the back yard watching the sky. The first thing we saw was a dim light we thought was a satellite because we see them all the time. The odd thing about this one was that as we watched it, it would get VERY bright and then fade to a dim light about every 10 sec. It did not seem to be as high as we normally see satellites. Julie began to count the approx. seconds between the bright and dim cycles. It appeared overhead and we watched it until it disappeared in the North. We are not sure if this was anything but a satellite.At 11:30 PM Julie began saying,&quot;look at that&quot;,&quot;look at that&quot;! I looked up towards the West and saw a squadron of small disk shaped objects flying in real tight formation, traveling from West to East over our heads. The moon was almost full in the SE. It seemed that the leading edge was illuminated by the moon, giving these object the appearance of a crescent shape. I estimate that there may have been 10-15 or more of these objects. The formation was irregular, not like Air Force formation flying. We watched them fade from view to the East. There was no sound and the movement was very smooth. They were possibly around 800-1000 ft. high, (this is an approximation as the sky was totally clear).I do not know if the pulsating light and the squadron had anything to do with each other, but the cluster of crescent shapes was certainly hair raising. They were moving very fast. We only saw them for about 7-9 seconds.My wife and I have had another sighting.  Sunday night (6/21/97) at 11:15 PM we were in the back yard watching the sky.

19971013	19971101	 Buffalo, NY	 other	4500	Summary : Please Not PostThis isn&apos;t exactly a UFO sighting, but my dog needed to go out, so about 3:am I put her out, had a drink of water and a smoke, I noticed up in the sky, a comet shaped oject (tear drop at a 45 Degree Angle) between the middle star of Orion and his lower 2 star legs. Its was fading in and out much like Hale-Bop and it was at a roughly 45 degree angle, in for 10 seconds out for 10 seconds... Its was stationary for abut 45-1:30 minutes before the sun came up, then I losted tracked. I understand this wasn&apos;t a UFO but a weird comet like object in the sky and I undertstand that you may not be the correct people to speak too but I called my local FBI and they didn&apos;t seem to be too interested. I understand this is halloween and they probably get a lot of crack pots but I didn&apos;t know were else to turn. The FBI wanted to patch me through to the Air Force and I knew this wasn&apos;t a UFO, just a strange comet that I knew wasn&apos;t suppost to be in the star cluster of Orion, as I use Orion as my personal guide to find the rest of the night sky everynight. I also understand that tonight we could of been having Ice crystals forming in the sky, but the rest of the stars looked crystal clear, it was just this one tear drop shaped object. If you would like to contact me for a better and more detailed report&hellip;((Name and number deleted))

It appeared for a while that there were clouds in front ofthe object, and later the clouds were behind it. I saw the object in the nothern sky, while I was star gazing.I took some pictures and am waiting for them to develop.At approx. 22:45, I had gone outside to chart its locationand take some pictures. After this I took my flashlight outand started flashing at the object seeing if I could get its attention. I started to move closer in my direction, not knowingw hy, I went into my house.  I then watched the object from my bedroom window.

19970510	19970513	 Los Padres National Forest (Ventura Co.), CA	 other	5min.	Summary : Observed two objects. One with flashing multi-colored lights, the second, somewhat bell-shaped with two white-yellow lights. They hovered above us and appeared to be observing us.On May 10, 1997 we were camping in a remote part of Los Padres National Forest. Our party consisted of myself, my wife ((Three names deleted)). Our location was a campsite known as Thorn Meadows, approximately 20 miles west of the small town of Lake of the Woods, in Ventura county. The elevation there is approximately 4000 ft., the winds were calm, the sky was clear, the stars were bright. A crescent moon was descending. We had camped at this site on two other occasions and although it is very remote, this was the first time we had not seen any other people in the area all day.At approximately 10:45 PM, we were finishing cleaning up after dinner. We had a fire burning. ((Name deleted)), pointing to the northeastern sky, said something to effect of, &quot;Hey, what is that thing? I&rsquo;ve been watching it for a while and I can&rsquo;t figure out what it is.&quot; I looked in the direction he was pointing and I saw a flashing light, at approximately 50 degrees. At first I thought it was someone walking down the hill with a flashlight because of the erratic way it was flashing. I then realised that this could not be because there was no hill in that direction. After watching it for approx. 30 seconds, I realised two things: one, the flashing light it was emitting was rapidly changing color; two, it was moving in an unpredictable, erratic manner that could not possibly have been an airplane or helicopter. It was moving in a way that seemed to indicate it was searching for something. At that instant, I realised immediately it was not an ordinary aircraft. The object then changed dire!ction and came directly at us in a straight line moving at a high rate of speed which I could not quantify. The object then stopped in plain view, at roughly the same angle to the horizon. I found this very disturbing. Then ((Name deleted)) said, &quot;Look, there&rsquo;s another one.&quot; I turned my head and saw to the southeast, at approximately 30 degrees, another object that had, to me, appeared out of nowhere and was now hovering almost directly above us. This object was different from the other, it had two bright, white-yellow lights and seemed vaguely bell-shaped. Both objects were completely silent and up there you can hear a plane from miles away. I had the distinct but inexplicable sense that they were looking at us. I could not estimate the size or altitude of the objects, but the second object had a similar appearance to a helicopter hovering at maybe 1500 ft. In other words, it was clearly visible.I was quite frightened but ((Name deleted))was absolutely terror-stricken. She was completely resolute that we needed to leave immediately. Seeing the second object sitting up above us was all I needed to make up my mind to go. In seconds we gathered up the dogs, extinguished the fire and got in the truck and I drove as fast as I could down the dirt road. At one point, my wife saw the first object off to the right of our vehicle and believes it was following us. I did not see it and so cannot verify. Later I realised that we were in a classic abduction scenario and I&rsquo;m glad we left, although I wonder if I would have had it not been for my wife&rsquo;s urging. I also realise that if they really wanted us, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance. We spent the night in a motel room in town and went back early in the morning to gather up our things.Let me give you some background here for a frame of reference. I am a skeptical person by nature. In my youth I heard the stories of UFOs and thought, &quot;Well, that could be, but I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.&quot; Then, a number of years ago I read Communion which led to my reading a few other books on the subject. Then I realised what was really going on. However, I am most certainly not one of those people that goes around trying to spot UFOs, in fact the opposite is true. After reading Communion, I hoped to never see one of those things. I have spent a lot of time looking at the night sky and have never, until now, seen anything that was completely inexplicable. I am convinced that there is no way these objects that we witnessed could have been some experimental aircraft. The way they accelerated, stopped, changed direction, I don&rsquo;t believe that a human would be able to withstand the g forces that would have been generated.
19970812	19970812	 Papillion, NE	 light	2-5 seconds	Summary : Me, and two of my friends were outside late tuesday night, when we saw five lights in a pentagon shape. The lights started moving slowly to our right, and then went out, kind of like turning out a light.Me and my two best friends were sitting out in my back yard, because we wer having a sleep over, at around 10:00 p.m. We had got a nice conversation going, when all of a sudden Kim, one of my friends, pointed out toward the sky. Me and Megan turned our heads. Staring in amzement we saw five big, bright lights, too bright to be stars. We all noticed that the lights were arranged as the points of a pentagon. I belive that there was only one object. The lights moved rather slow to the right, then disapeared. It all seamed so fast. Right after that we ran inside, and started writting stuff down, like the time, the shape of the lights and other stuff. I remembered my dad, and my brother talking about a contest, and how they were stuck on a question. thats when I noticed this report place. I ran to the basement turned on the computer and came here.      My two friends as far as I know are very trust worthy. I have known them all through elementary school.
19770701	19971130	 Anniston (Ft. McClellan U.S. Army base), AL	 disk	5 seconds(?)	Summary : Approx. six glowing silent objects flying over head at high rate of speed in broad daylight at ft. Mcclellan, Alabama July 1977Solid overcast day. Objects glowed and details of construction could not be seen other than the fact they appeared to be saucer shaped and at a low altitude due to cloud cover. I watched them for approx. 5 seconds until they flew out of sight over the trees. I saw them very clearly, most amazing thing I&apos;ve ever seen. I don&apos;t know who else saw it because I didn&apos;t ask.  .
19971215	19971225	 Marlette, MI	 circle	approx. 3 minutes	Summary : A large solid noiseless object, possibly round, with four lights, passed slowly over a residential neighborhood in Marlette, MI.  It had two large steady lights, a yellowish white light trailed by a large red light.  Two small lights strobed simultaneously, one on each side of the craft.A large golden light was observed in the eastern sky at 23:35 pm EST in Marlette, Michigan.  The witness, a 52 year old professional, was frightened as she knew instantly that this light, coming towards her home, was not an aircraft.  Her son is an ET experiencer that has worked with Michigan MUFON representatives and has had several close-proximity UFO sightings himself.  He was out of state at the time of this sighting.  The woman, opened her doorwall to go onto her patio to look up at the approaching object but became scared and retreated back indoors.  She again opened her door to go out but again retreated indoors.  As this object slowly appoached she could distinguish other lights on it.  She heard absolutely no sound from it through the sighting.  As the object came nearer she could make out two very large steady lights that seemed to be structures lit from inside.  A large yellowish white light trailed closely by a large steady red light.  There were two small blinking lights, one on each edge at the 3 o&apos;clock and 9 o&apos;clock positions (she believes this was a solid round object although she could not actually see the structure).  As it silently drifted over the house at the speed of a small single engine aircraft, which is common in Marlette, she remembered her son&apos;s insistance that she should measure any object with her two fingers at arm&apos;s length.  The object was approximately 2 1/2 to 3 inches at arm&apos;s length.  She ran back in doors frightened as it passed over.  The sighting duration was approximately 2-3 minutes.  It should also be noted that her husband had reported a UFO to Michigan MUFON at the beginning of December.  His sighting was of a bank of approximately seven bright lights that hovered stationary at 35 degrees from his parked car and then vanished.  This occurred in Peck, MI. I am the witness&apos;s son..

19970727	19970819	 Las Cruces, NM	 light	1 hr approx	Summary : Witness reports an &quot;orange ball of light&quot; at approx 500 feet from ground, was surrounded by helicopters circling it repeatedly. Number of aircraft was 4 to 6 and repeated manuevers went on for one hour plus. No reports (that i know of) were made in local papers or tv news. Many people MUST have seen this as helicopters continued to fly over city a low altitude for 2-3 hours after incident. This one ought to be investigated by competent party while it is fresh.
19971023	19971024	 Billings, MT	 cylinder	16:30-16:33	Summary : Dark gray, cylindrical, object about 100m wide and 40m tall.  Hovered in circle, about 20 miles away.First it was vertical and spinning, then horizontal and moving in a slow circle in the same spot in the sky.  Dark gray, wide and short, at one point looked like a circle. Was weaving around for about 3 minutes and was as big as a water tower that was near it. the background was overcast light gray.

Appear as large as airplanes approaching Dallas/Ft.Worth airport  but traveling faster than the normal airspeed of planes approaching the airport.  First looked like over size red lights on plane but speed faster took a closer look. Object than stopped giving off what appearred as flames from the bottom extremely white than a small white object decended straight down from the red object flames.  The white object disappear but could hear a pop sound at its disappearance.  Red object fades away.Same as above.  Observer is a motel clerk taking a cigarette break outside at time of sighting.
19960901	19970322	 Concord, MA	 disk	?	Summary : Large saucer spotted hovering above trees.I am not sure of the exact date or time.It was either August or Sept. of last year.My sister, Paula, and I were on Route 2 in Concord, heading East toward Boston after afishing trip. It was dusk. As we neared afield, I saw a large saucer, grey with alarge white highly luminescent dome on top.There were what appeared to be portholes or windows around it. My sister was not paying attention as we sped past it but I started yelling &apos;Oh my God! Look over the trees! Seeit? See it?&apos; She said she saw a very bright object in the sky but could not quite make itout. By the time she looked up it was pretty much obscured. I turned the car around as soon as I hada chance to get another look, but it was no longer there.I have also seen instances of bizarre lights in the sky which appear to be above the clouds, and they make really odd formations. At first I thought they were searchlights that stores and discos usesometime, but the stream of light coming down from the sky that usually tells youthese are earth-based lights were notpresent. The formations these lights created could not have been made by aircraft.There were usually four to five lights.At some point, they would all convert together to create a single point of light and thensplit up again. I saw these on numerous occaisions when heading east on Route 2 nearConcord, MA, going toward Boston last year.On one occaision, my sister Paula also saw these.It is interesting to note, I guess, that Hanscom AFB is off Route 2 (actually, it&apos;s on2A), in Bedford, MA, which is just north ofConcord. I believe Dover AFB in NH is closeby as well.What took me so long to report these incidents? I did not know who to go to. I did not want to contact Hanscom for fear ofridicule. Thank you for your time, and if you wish, you may call me evenings (eastern time)
19970730	19970730	 Navarre, FL	 circle	10 minutes	Summary : Several bright lights that seemed to appear and disappear.  They were so bright they made the evening sky illuminate.  The clouds were radiant from the lights.  They appeared circular in shape.The number of them changed.  The most at any one time was about 6.  They were circular in shape and appeared to be bright lights.  They would just appear and disappear for a few minutes.  There seemed to be others behind the clouds from the way the clouds illuminated although we could not tell this for sure.
19970915	19971101	 Farrell, PA	 disk	3-5 min	Summary : Low-flying, object prior to west to east moving severe storm on PA/OH border.I was returning home from work on a Friday afternoon.  A major thunder storm was approaching from the west.  Hozel road heads north from Swamp Road.  It then takes a 90 degree turn west for about 800 yards before intersecting Radio Road, which runs north.  About 300 yards prior to the intersection, I observed an object about 700-800 yards distant at tree-top level.  I took no immediate notice because there is a large blue-green water tower located in the general direction.  This tower, however, is only visible from Radio Road about 200 yards north of the mentioned intersection.  When I took deliberate notice, I observed a disk-shaped object with a small cylindrical superstructure centered on the upper half of the disk. This structure&apos;s top came to a point.  The object was silver in color but didn&apos;t shine; like lead. I saw no movement or heard no noise.  I glanced at the road then back at the tree-tops and the craft was gone.  This had taken seconds so I was not sure what had just happened (or if it happened.)  As I turned north on Radio Road, I glanced to my left, over a farmer&apos;s  field and again saw the object, this time almost totally below the tree-tops and on a sharp (45 degree+) angle (north side lower than south side of craft.) This was at about 300 yards.  From this point I could also see the water tower.  It was clear they were not the same object. The flying object did, however, closely resemble the top of the water tower in shape (definetly not in color or direction.) I turned my attention back to the road and once again, the object was gone.  Several months later, I was relating this story to my Brother-in-law and his girlfriend.  The girl got a little upset.  Talking to her, I found that her bedroom window looked out over this same field from it&apos;s northern edge.  She said she had occasion to witness bright lights coming from the field at night, more than once.
19970803	19970803	 Bakersville, NC	 light	15 secs	Summary : A bright light with a long tail (presumed to be a meteroite) was sited moving slowly across the eastern sky, in a south to north direction. The object faded out and the mountain valley had the odor of smoke.My brothers were standing on the back porch, around 10:00 pm. One of them noticed a slow moving firey orange light traveling in a north to south direction in the eastern sky. He called it to the attention of my other brother, so both of them witnessed the site. My brothers noticed that our horses became excited as the intensity of the object&apos;s brightness decreased. The object appeared to burn out and the mountain valley appeared to become foggy. The odor smoke was quite strong and noted by others who had no idea of what had just happened. I, myself, witnessed the smokey odor and the fogginess of the mountian valley (as seen through the security lights at night). Because of the smokiness, we were concerned about the possibility of a fire, so we reported this event to the sheriff&apos;s office by calling 911. No noise was noted when the object disappeared, so we assumed that the object disintegrated in the air and that there was no impact. We believe this object was possibly a meteriote, and would like to report this to whoever would be interested. Please forward this report to the proper parties.
19971024	19971027	 Houston, TX	 triangle	5-6  seconds	Summary : Witnessed black, metallic UFO pass by airplane window at 28,000 feet.  Witnessed by several people in daylight.Friday, 10/24/97 at approx. 6:00pm (Mountain Time).  Continental Airlines flight #1807 from Houston to Phoenix.  Shortly after takeoff witnessed a black, semi-matte, metallic craft fly right past the airplane through the window.  It was traveling east - opposite direction of the plane - and was visible as it flew past for about 6 seconds.  Size and distance from plane couldn&apos;t accurately be determined, but it was incredibly close to the plane. It had a triangular upper half, but the lower half was rounded and dome-shaped.  This occured at 28,000 feet (the pilot had announced the plane&apos;s altitude only minutes before.)  3 to 4 other people also witnessed the object as it flew by.  It was daylight and it was clear enough to see the object had definate edges and form (i.e. it wasn&apos;t just a dark shape seen out of the corner of the eye.) The observer has had past training in local law enforcement as well as some FBI training, and would not be described as a typical believer in such things as UFOs.
19970313	19970327	 Northwest Tempe, AZ	 formation	15 minutes	Summary : We saw 5 red lights, in a V formation, from the north to the south, in a fifteen minute period.Sitting outside my place of employment, I noticed red lights in the horizon, directly north of us. After noticing, I jokingly said, &quot;Hey guys, I think i see a UFO!&quot;  This was more of a gut fealing than a joke.  My four friends then saw what I was looking at. Since we were right by Skyharbor Airport, there were commercial planes flying East and West.  The red lights seamed to be lower in altittued and oblivious to the fact that it was flying directly toward commercial aircraft traffic.  They were in a V formation, three red lights in front, two red lights behind and to each side.  As they moved closer to us we moved into our parking lot.  There seemed to be no &quot;body&quot; to this aircraft, only lights.  When directly overhead, it was so large, it wouldnt fit it into direct vision, I had to shift my eyes to see the entire object.  At this time, we realized that this was not one object, it was five, or more.  The red light in back and to my right, was trailing slightly.  In talking !with my co-workers, some say the lights were red, and some say they were orange.  The lights slowly moved to the South, and then they were gone.  Then the following day, we saw the six o&apos;clock news ( at work ) and all doubts were gone, it was a UFO!
19860701	19970614	 Halandri (Near Athens) (Greece),	 cylinder	1 1/2 mins	Summary : 250 foot silver cylinderAt 1700 (Greek time) I observed a 100 foot silver cylinder very slowly moving horizontally across the sky.  It was metalic in appearance and about 1500 feet from me. The newspaper: The Athens News reported a slow moving UFO being tracked over Isreal about two weeks later.
19970511	19970511	 Porter, TX	 other	15 minutes	Summary : We saw &quot;rocks&quot; floating in the air, they drifted over the trees.  They appeared to be floating.  Atleast 10 cars were pulled over on the side of the road.  I knew my daughters and I were not seeing things.I picked up my daughters from a slumber party on FM 1314.  We travelled to Porter which is off of HWY 59.  My 11 year old asked &quot;Mom, oh my God, what is that in the sky?&quot;  I turned around at the Kroger right under the underpass.  She sounded frantic.  I looked and safely said&quot;Probably parachutes.&quot;  I drove back to 59 and proceeded to travel slowly on the feeder road going south towards Houston.  I was shocked and amazed at what I saw.  I looked around me and cars were pulling over on the sides of the road to see the objects.  There were about 15-20.  They looked like rocks or meteors floating suspended in the air.  I pulled over at a car dealership on the right and stared at them.  It was so unreal.  Like I was in a movie and it wasn&apos;t really happening.  One of the rocks looked very strange.  They were all at different altitudes and they were moving slowly towards the west/southwest.  I became aware of the fact that these objects could drop strait on our heads at any second,!so I backed out and left.  I turned around at the next exit.  By the time I got back to the spot and on the other side of the road heading north, the last of them could be seen just over the tree tops.  I headed up 1314 to Conroe.  I thought I could see them from the 242 loop, but no luck.  I don&apos;t know where they went or what in the world they were, but I would like to know if something like meteors can come into our atmosphere and float that way.  They appeared to be in 0 gravity.  With all of the others that saw I know I can&apos;t explain it away.
19971020	19971017	 Rome/Armuchee (between), GA	 light		Summary : ON THE 20 OF SEPT WE SAW BIG BRIGTH LIGHT IT CAME DOWNON SEPT. THE LIGHT LOOK LIKE THE SKY WAS DAY TIME IT CAME DOWN MY SON AND I WATCH IT GO BEHAND SOME TREES
19971122	19971122	 Albuquerque, NM	 other	3 minutes	Summary : A black object that at first looked like a hot air balloon, then a 747, then roundish. It appeared black against the twilight blue sky. A faint sound like distant chopper sounds. I was looking at it with another co-worker and it came to a stop. Then it slowly grew smaller and was gone. But it wasn&apos;t moving. Almost like a cloaking device. I have never seen a UFO, and I personally think it&apos;s a bunch of BS, but this freaked me out.I have got to go, I&apos;m at work.
19970705	19970506	 Fos sue Mer/Salon de Provnce (Between) (France),	 light	25 minuts	Summary : A huge light that most of all seemed like those light-balls in the discoteques followedour car. We were alone at the road and when we stopped to verify it stopped too. It was not a helicopter &apos;cause there were no sound at all and it mooved almost 25 km. so it wasn&apos;t a light comming from the ground neither.We were 4 people comming from a practice session with our salsa band. We had to drive app. 30 km to get home and when we got out of the city the girl in the back saw &quot;something iin the sky&quot; so first we thought that there was a party going on somewhere. But as it was still there 5 minutes later we thought that it could bea car mooving with a light on lthe roof or something like that. But when we realized that it was a forest ti couldn&apos;t be that neither. Therefore, even I, who normally does not belive in such things, started to get nervous. We tried to stop the car to see if we could hear something but no sounds were there besides some birds. The sky was not cloudy but not totally free from clouds neither. There were som kindof fog. But it could not be a helicopter; if it were a helicopter I would have been able to see it above. An det light was not comming from the ground neither. We started the car again an drove app. 10 kmBut as it was &quot;following&quot; us we stopped the car once more. When we stopped the car it stopped too. It was always right beside us. When we passed through a small village we thought that we had lost it, but when we got through it rejoined us beside the road. We were driving from Fos sur Mer to Salon de Provence in South France. The singer who was sitting in the back (the girl who first saw the thing) claimed that she had seen exately the same ting in December last year with 2 friends as they were taking a walk in the forest. But it has only lasted for app. 10 seconds. This time the light followed the car for app. 25 km even when we took some sharp turns and when wh changed the road etc. it was right beside us.The Light:It was round but not like a circle. It was more like some small sqaures of light that was turning first one way and then the other in a smooth way. The center changed size all the time; it was like someting pulsing - like a heart. Around of the center there were the smaller squars of light og allwas turned in the same direction.It was like one of the best science fiction moovies ! It changed size, higth and speed. And it was sure that it followed us because wo drove app. 3 km through the city and made some very sharp turns. If it had been something from the ground id would have had to pass through a forest, a lake and one more forest. If it was comming from the sky it made no sound at all and it could see us even when we drove with the lights out. When we arrived at Salon de Provence it stopped following us and returned to where we came from.We were all affraid as it was clear that this could not be explained. Even the driver who is a non-believer was affraid.The persons in the car:  ((4 names deleted)). I am writing this with all the risk to called stupid og non realistic but I hope it can help if other people will report the same thing. Please do not hessitate to mail me back for further information (if there is any).I am writing this at the time of my return i.e. 10 minutes after the episode.  ((Name deleted))
19971123	19971123	 Wichita Falls (Sheppard AFB), TX	 light	3 seconds	Summary : A bright green light appeared low on the horizon. Made a arc movement from the northern horizon up about 15 degrees and went down over the tops of neighboring houses.  Holding my fist at arms length it was about half the size of my fist. It disappeared and never came back.  I am in the US airforce and have never seen any aircraft move like this.  I believe it was a meteor but it was awful low on the horizon.
19820907	19970419	 Palm Desert, CA	 disk	30 secondds	Summary : Five golden (like harvest moon)  saucer-shaped objects flying in V-formation from West to East over distant mountain range (15 miles?) in Palm Desert, CAee - (30 seconds)  kind of disappeared with litle sparkles of light.Me-always interested in UFOs - wanted to see one.  This was a genuine sighting - no fuzzy lights or maybes.  Havent seen anything  it since, but did see stuff at Area 51.  Went to UFO Congress in 93, became CSETI Direc tor in SF, CA, also do UFO trips with Beyond Boundaries.  Still fascinated.Hubby - not interested. Could care less. &quot;How does it effect me?&quot; he says.  Afraid of not being &quot;normal&quot;  Says, &quot;Well, I saw something.Some kind of lights in the sky&apos;  I say, &quot;Ohh, you think they were airplanes?&quot; &quot;Of course not!! They ere going too fast and didn&apos;t look like planes.&quot;
19960815	19970314	 Grand Rapids, MI	 light	20-30 min	Summary : Two small objects that appeared to be non-teresteralA friend and myself saw a small dot that was very hard to notice at first in the sky directly above us. We were star gazing.  It was very high and it was red.  It wasnt a sattalite or any conventional aircraft.  It would slow downand speed up and most oddly it would make turns of which i have never seen atthe speed in which it appeared to be traveling.  After 20 minutes or so it disappeared over the treeline and the 10 minutes later it returned with asecond object, also moving about oddly.  They both dashed about for a few minutes, going in triangle shaped motions, then eventually disappeared again,for good this time.  I have told many peopel this story and i was referred tothis page by one of them, so there is my story.  I still dont know if it wasa ufo, but thats what I believe it was.
19971130	19971202	 Sacramento, CA	 flare	30 seconds	Summary : I think we saw something simular as discribed on the Art Bell Show last night.  A flair would be an accurate discription.  Would have been just as the pilot said.  The trail behind was the flair exhaust.  Not trying to disprove, just say it as I saw it.  Bright, red, maybe metal on fire with smoke from behind.I think we saw something simular as discribed on the Art Bell Show last night.  A flair would be an accurate discription.  Would have been just as the pilot said.  The trail behind was the flair exhaust.  Not trying to disprove, just say it as I saw it.  Bright, red, maybe metal on fire with smoke from behind.  My wife and my kids all saw it from our van.  I have 20/15 if not better vision and blue eyes to see a night.  Could have been a few people pulling our leg.
0000	19971202	 Morrice, MI	 cigar	3-5 minutes	Summary : Large and small identical craft hovered at tree top level for several minutes 2- yards from 2 observers in small, rural Michigan community of 500 people.On a warm, clear, dark and moonless summer night (June, July or August ?), circa 1962, my grand mother and I watched in dumbstruck silence as a 100&apos; long object closely resembling a DC-3/6 fuselage sans wings, a tail or exterior lights, approached and hovered over the rural residential community of Morrice, MI at tree-top level. From a distance of 20 yards, the UFO displayed multiple lighted windows ala a commercial airliner of that era....along entire length of body.  After hovering motionless for 1-2 minutes, the tail ramp of craft dropped open in fashion similar to ramps of &apos;60&apos;s military cargo planes and subsequent Boeing 727 aircraft.  A coverall clad, normal sized human looking &quot;man&quot; walked out on the lowered ramp and physically signaled to the  visible pilot of an identical air craft 1/10 the size of the first vessel,that quickly apporached and stopped (hovered) 10 yards aft the larger aircraft.  The smaller aircraft entered the rear of the larger &quot;mother&quot; vessel in a! matter of seconds and the ramp door closed behind it, curtailing the yellow incandescent type light emitted from the larger aircraft&apos;s interior.  After a few moments, the droning RPM&apos;s of the unidentified craft increased as it moved off to the west at an estimated speed of 25 MPH, still just above the tree tops.  Local TV news the following night (Sunday) reported that UFO&apos;s (&quot;Ha!, Ha!) were sighted over Flint and Lansidng the night before.  Morrice is located just about half-way between those two larger cities. Both vessels were dark in color, but presumably metalic.  At first we could only see the outline of the larger vessel, but as our eyes adjusted and focused, we could the vessel rather well against a dark, cloudless, night sky.  The propulsion noise of the large vessel was similar to, yet, different than the sound of two diesel locomotive&apos;s whose engines, side by side, non-synchronously vibrating the air. The larger aircraft, again, lacked both wings and a tail, but was roundly &quot;pointed&quot; in the front akin to the shape of a traditional commercial or military aircraft. In fact, at first sight, I thought I was observing a slow moving airliner.  The shape of the larger vessel(s) in retrospect, was cigar like.  The smaller &quot;scout&quot; or &quot;shuttle&quot; vessel bore a front window large (possibly a clear canopy) enough to evidence a pilots head sillouhetted by background lighting from within the cockpit interior.  The shape of that head appeared to be that of what I would consider a normal hum! an being. The smaller craft could not be heard over the propulsion noise of the larger vessel, accounting perhaps for it&apos;s unexpected appearance out of the completely dark sky.  The beings I observed, looked like ordinary human individuals, the one on the larger craft being approximately 5&apos;8&quot; to 6&apos;0&quot; in height, and again, wearing what I described then at age 12 or 13, coveralls.  I would, today, after having served in the military, refer to the same clothing as a jump suit or a flight suit.  There was nothing extra terrestrial about this sighting.  In fact, the only thing that seemed unusual to me at the time and to this day, was the absence of wings, an air speed too low for even a four place Cesna to stay aloft, the stationary hovering, and the surprising appearance of the second smaller, identical vessel. The event reminded me the recovery of an amphibeous landing craft seen in WWII movies and in photographs. I recently spoke with a retired USAF Colonel, who claimed that &quot;TOP-TOP-SECRET-SECRET&quot; design and testing of aircraft was rumored to be taking place at one or more of the AF bases in Michigan (Wurtsmith, K.A. Sawyer, Kincheloe, Kinross, Selfridge ?) in the nineteen fifties and sixties.  Perhaps that is precisely what my grand mother and I observed.  I can recall being frightened enough by what I saw, that I didn&apos;t walk from the backyard down the driveway to the street where I could have watched the vessel in question fly across two or three hundred more yards of open sky before being obstructed from view by trees and houses.  Oddly, I don&apos;t recall having a conversation about our shared sighting with my grandmother on that eventful night or the next day.  I can clearly remember telling my parents on the following evening upon my return home, about what we saw, and becoming quite excited when the eleven O&apos;clock news backed up my most unusual account.
19710610	19970516	 Spokane, WA	 disk	5 minutes	Summary : Sighting of a large metal flying object.  The object was metal, flat-bottomed, with a sloped dome in the center.  An Air Force jet was in pursuit.  The metal object was at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.In 1971, when I lived in Spokane, WA, I saw a UFO.  I was finished with my shift as a Registered Nurse at Deaconess Hospital, enroute to meet my fiance.  We planned to see a movie at the Garland Theater on the north end of the city.  It was midweek, a Wednesday or Thursday, and the date may have been 6/10/71.As I drove north up the Monroe Street hill at approximately 3:50 PM (my shift ended at 3:30 PM), I had to put down the sun visor because a bright light was hitting me in the eyes.  When I reached the top of the hill, I stopped for a traffic light.  It was then that I noticed that the bright light was reflecting off a metal flying object that I can only describe as a &quot;flying saucer&quot;.  The surface of the object was metal, the color of aluminum or stainless steel.  The object was round, flat on the bottom, and with a sloped dome in the center.  This &quot;flying saucer&quot; was not high in the sky, but at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.  An Air Force jet of similar size was in pursuit of the UFO at the same altitude and close behind.I thought the jet might be based at nearby Fairchild Air Force Base.When the traffic light turned green, I proceeded on my way and lost sight of the UFO.  I have no explanation as to what it was, only that I have never seen anything like it before or since.
19970522	19970523	 Simi Valley, CA	 formation	4 Min.	Summary : &quot;Delta&quot; shaped group of motionless bright red lights sighted over Simi Valley, Calif.At about 9:25 p.m. on the evening of May 22, 1997 in the Southern California city of Simi Valley (about 25 miles NW of L.A.), while returning home from a Boy Scout meeting, my 12 year old son and I noticed an unusually bright red object in the Northern sky.  We pulled into the parking lot of a local school and exited our vehicle to get a better observation.  What we saw appeared to be not one but a &quot;tight&quot; group of perhaps 10-15 extremely bright red lights in the shape of a flat triangle or &quot;delta&quot; at about 330 degrees (looking towards the Big Dipper constellation).  The objects semed perfectly motionless and emitted a constant bright reddish glow.  We observed no blinking of the lights, nor any other lights of another color (such as white aircraft lights).  After approximately 4-5 minutes of observing these objects, they appeared to suddenly dim and then suddenly disappeared from sight as if they lifted vertically at an extremely high rate of speed.  We heard no particular !sounds during this event.   We then returned home and shortly thereafter telephoned NUFORC to report the event as aforesaid.   We have not previously observed such an event as this and are very &quot;impressed&quot; at whatever our sighting was.   We have since accesses the NUFORC web site and have noticed very similar sightings in North America in the recent past.  We would be pleased to further discuss our sighting with NUFORC.
19970403	19970403	 Port Wentworth, GA	 other	5 minutes	Summary : object travelled at approx 800feet. moving north to south over savannah international airport at about 500 mph. no engine noise or exhaust. made sharp 90 degree turn to east towards city of savannah Ga.I was proceeding from I 95 to work at Gulfstream aerospace down back road from Savannah international airport, when I saw what I first thought was an aircraft in landing approach.  Object was about the size of a Large fighter jet or small executive jet such as a learjet. The craft was of a shiny polished mettalic appearance it was travelling at a much higher than normal speed for a landing aircraft (est 400-500mph.) Altitude appeared to be about 800 to 1000 feet.coming from due north, . the craft overflew the north south runway of the airport then made a sharp left turn and went out of sight heading east towards Savannah Ga.Ther was no engine noise, no visible exhaust, no propellers. Seen from the side the craft appeared to have short stubby wings or none at all. the fuselage was more rounded or domed than normal aircraft, although It did not appear to have the classic saucer shape. I Have worked at Gulfstream aerospace and have seen a wide variety of aircraft landing and taking off at Savannah Intenational, and have never seen an aircraft of this type before.
19630601	19970705	 Laguna Beach (south), CA	 light	several minutes	Summary : USO(s) - Unidentified Submerged Object(s) -- yeh! I know guys! You probably only care about lights in the sky! But hey I&apos;m not the only one that saw it! Although the other guy doesn&apos;t know I exist.It was around June? of 1964. Best man preparing bridal suite. I finished and went for a walk on the sand. A long wooden stair case led down the cliffs to the beach and the waves appeared to be in the cliffs&apos; shadow from Highway 1 headlights. I saw a series of lights glowing from behind the waves about 5 ? feet apart and 8 ? inches in diameter. It/they gave the appearance of portholes on the side of a submersible. I have no explanation. When they interviewed a CA lighthouse keeper on the radio (his station was becoming automated - and you had to walk through a tunnel to reach it) and asked him if in all of his years of watching the surf he had seen anything strange - he reported seeing the same thing -- with no idea what it could be!

19961209	19970421	 Highway 15, NV		60 sec.	The caller and his work companion were driving to work on Route 15.  Suddenly, both of them saw in the morning sky what looked to be &quot;(a cloud of) liquid&quot; hovering in the sky.  It was reddish-green (?) in color.  The object (?) was extremely bright, it seemed to give off a high pitched noise, and it moved in front of their car, causing them to stop on the highway.   It appeared to be &quot;gigantic&quot; from their vantage point, &quot;as big as an apartment building.&quot; Other cars were slowing, as well, to look at it. The caller got out of the car and ran &quot;back.&quot;  (Away from it??)   Then the object began moving across the sky in front of their car.

19970401	19970402	 Scarborough (Canada), ON	 triangle	30 sec.	The caller and her three daughters were outside looking at the comet with their binoculars.  She looked at the Big Dipper, when she noticed an object moving &quot;fast&quot; across the night sky, which &quot;entranced&quot; the four of them. The object had a &quot;rounded triangular&quot; shape to the front of it, and it had &quot;twenty or so&quot; solid, distinct white lights on the leading edge of it.  It was larger than a clenched fist at arm&apos;s length, I.e. larger than a full moon.As the object moved rapidly to the south, it just seemed to disappear from sight.  The mother ran around the house to follow it as it moved south, but it was gone from sight before she could get there. They watched the object with binoculars, and all four of them drew its shape.
19970528	19970720	 Urubamba (outside Cusco, Peruvian Andes) (Peru),	 light	few seconds	Summary : A fast moving &quot;body of Light&quot; sweeps over us as we star watch in the Sacred Valley of the Incas outside Cusco Peru at an elevation of l0,000&apos;  The night was clear, cold and very dark (no moon).  The &quot;Light&quot; was seen coming from the southwest directly over a 600&apos; peak just in front of us.  It was bright white and seemed to have mass, but no structure was perceived by the two witnesses.  It was approximately a half mile in width and moving at a &quot;very high speed&quot; ...I had been asked to build a &quot;walking meditation garden maze&quot; for a large resort in the Peruvian Andes.  Upon completion of the maze I invited the owners and a friend for a small ceremony to dedicate the Classical 7-Path Labyrinth to the healing and well being of our planet Earth.  It was the last few days of late May around 9pm in the evening on a star lit clear night, no moon.  Following the short dedication ceremony the four of us stood watching the heavens, Maria del Carmen and I faced the sacred mountain &quot;Yawar Maki&quot; which juts up from the Urubamba river a few feet from where we stood.  She and I were looking up over the peak at the Southern Cross when suddenly a &quot;large body&quot; of fast moving light sped directly over our heads.  In fact both of us almost fell backwards as we followed the light with our heads craning backwards.  Across the sky overhead it moved and then just disappeared into thin air.  The two men were looking in the other direction and by the time they hea! rd our squeals and looked in our direction, the body of light has completely disappeared.  The entire event took not more than a matter of seconds.  This was neither airplane or lightning, this we know, what is was through is still to be known.  The creation of this particular Labyrinth is as a healing center for tourists and pilgrims visiting the ancient sacred sites in this area of the Andes.  In myth and folklore, the Labyrinth traditions tell of many unusual stories such as that of Scandinavian sailors who would use the labyrinth in a form of sympathetic magic to control the weather.  It is also energetically linked with the seven major energy centers in the bodies auric field, the tones on the scale, and the 7 primary colors in the rainbow.  Unusual phenomena has been recounted in relation to the labyrinth for the past 3,500 years and in fact the act of walking a labyrinth still seems to draw transformative events to the practitioner.  I and maria del Carman both feel thi! s ususal &quot;event&quot; and our walking and dedication somehow are united.  I have never seen a UFO but I came away from this experience feeling like I had seen something I could not explain by conventional terms.  Both Maria del Carmen and her husband, a famous British journalist recounted several sightings during the past year and a half they&apos;ve owned the hotel and lived in this part of the Andes.  They tell me these type stories are common and knowledge of &quot;craft&quot; is widespread and seen by many.  In fact, a lake just over the peak we had stood in front of  called &quot;Chequerec&quot; is known locally as the &quot;UFO Lake&quot; and for the past l00 years (and probably more) stories have been told of craft coming and going from the lake and tales of &quot;little green men&quot; etc.  After this experience I asked around to the native people, the Quechua.  Everyone had a story which was usually told in a matter of fact demeanor as something as natural as the sun coming up each day. Another Indian friend that I ! would describe as being educated, soft-spoken and extremely low profile, and who&apos;d lived many years at the ancient site of Machu Picchu recounted a story.  He claims to have seen up to l7 &quot;ships&quot; on one night last November 1996.  As he told it, he was guiding an American woman into the sacred ruins late after midnight (which is allowed with special permission) when they both witnessed a litany of unusual &quot;lights&quot; above and around the old city.  He said he&apos;s not seen anything of this nature in the past  seven years, and believed that they&apos;d (the star people) returned.  This site has been known in local lore to be a place of intense UFO phenomena throughout the ages.

19970524	19970627	 Lake Tahoe (near), CA	 formation	20-30 min	Summary : A &quot;formation&quot; of very bright lights passing very slowly and silently overhead.  Must have been enormous.  Biggest and most unusual thing I have ever seen.I am writing about a &quot;phenomenon&quot; that I witnessed that was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seenbefore, so I guess it would fall under the description of a &quot;UFO&quot;. As a scientist with areasonable understanding of astronomy and meteorology, and with an equally good knowledgeof aircraft (both military and civilian), I can safely say that what my colleague and I witnessedwas something that I&apos;m sure would not fall into most of the easily explainable categories. On aclear night during the Memorial Day weekend (24th of May), I saw something that lookedabsolutely enormous moving across the sky in a westerly direction. Since all I could see werethe lights to this thing (very bright white lights), I couldn&apos;t make out the shape precisely.What was even more puzzling was that the lights seemed to move, ever so slightly, withrespect to each other, but it was definitely not a &quot;formation&quot; of any kind of aircraft like I hadever seen. Although I couldn&apos;t guage the exact size of the object since I didn&apos;t know whataltitude it was at (although I would guess it was pretty high), it appeared to be bigger thananything I&apos;ve ever seen flying before, maybe several times the size of a jumbo jet. There wasabsolutely no noise and it seemed to be moving very slowly. We were on a little stretch ofroad between Lake Tahoe and Interstate 80 and there were a lot of stars out, so I&apos;d be reallysurprized if others in the Lake Tahoe area didn&apos;t spot these strange lights, also. Have youreceived any reports of sightings like this in this part of the country? Because of my job, I amhesitant to &quot;go public&quot; with this kind of information, so I would appreciate it if you didn&apos;tpublish my name or email address. Please let me know if anyone is aware of any really strangemilitary exercises going on in this area.

It seemed far away, and looked likethe landing lights of a plane.  Werealized, however, that that was impossiblewhen we realized that it was not moving, andcouldn&apos;t be a helo that was hovering as itbeen there several minutes and was soundless.I am a pilot and would have been able toidentify whether or not it was a plane whenI looked at it through my binoculars.  Itappeared as a bright, central white lightsurrounded by smaller lights, not like thewingtip lights of a plane but completelyaround the central light, being of blue,green, and red color.  I noticed throughthe binoculars that the object would moveslowly, stop, then move again.  I sawsomething like this earlier (around July 2nd)and read in the paper about observers inLincoln on a lake and how the UFO they sawput out their campfires before taking offin the realtive direction of my town.  I ama very scientific, rational person, and justwant to know what it is I have been seeing.I would appreciate any and all the help youcan offer.  Thank you.

19970312	19970317	 New Orleans, LA	 other	5-10 Seconds	Summary : Are you interested in unexplained noises?At approximately 9:00 a.m. Wednesday, March 12, a huge boom rattled windows and residents throughout south Louisiana and Mississippi. The event, as yet unexplained, shook a surface area 80 miles n/s and 100 miles e/w.  Military installations in the area deny supersonic flight by any of their craft, and, at least on this occasion, they should be believed. This was no ordinary jet boom.  In mid New Orleans, people went into the streets to look for signs of the explosion.  The next day, newspapers reported the event, but, now, 5 days later, no explanation for the occurrence has been offered.I can send newpaper clipping if needed.  I would need a fax number
19660601	19970328	 Carson City, MI	 disk	5 minutes	Summary : My cousin &amp; I were both 7 and we were behind our grandmother&apos;s when we noticed a silver, smooth, shimering disc about 20&quot; wide and 10&quot; tall . We thought it was somthing fun looking so ran towards it and it shot up in a zig zag fashion then disappeared. Later my mother found a circle of coffee can sized holes in the field. A family outside of town had a strange craft hover over their house near the same time.My cosin and I were both 7. We were playing in a small field behind our Great grand mother&apos;s ,on the north edge of town. I don&apos;t remember exactly when but we both became aware of a silver metal object in the field. I remember thinking it was a metal pig hut because my older brother showed me one in the woods and told me that the pigs had gone feral and they would kill me if I went in the woods. I guess that was his attempt to protect me! Anyway, the object seemed to shimmer with heat waves and at some point we saw that it was a disc about twice as tall as a car and 3 times as long. I seem to remember that I could see under it like it was hovering close to the ground. We were not afraid at that time and decided to run up to it. we were about 50 feet away when it shot up on an angle to the right and appeared to be the size of a nickle , barely paused then shot up again on an angle to the left till at appeaed the size of a small pea then shot up to the right and disappeared. I !don&apos;t remember leaving the field but I remember running into my gramma&apos;s house and being very excited. My cousin moved to Washington state in the 70&apos;s. In 1983 he came to our grampa&apos;s funeral and I asked if he remembered it. He did. My mother did not believe us until we went on about it for several days. When she finally looked there was a series of coffee can sized holes near where the object was. A woman who lived 2 miles north of town told that at about that same time she and her kids (around my age) were watching TV at night when they heard sound like roof shingles slapping and the kids ran and looked out the windows. The kids claimed there was something hovering over the house with colored lights but the mother wouldn&apos;t look because she was afraid. I as female and my cousin is male. As far as I can nail it down, this was about 1966.

19970313	19970403	 Chandler (app. 20 miles E/SE of Phoenix), AZ	 triangle	1.5 min	Summary : My wife and I witnessed a craft passing in front uf us that was close to a mile long.This boomerang/trianglar craft became &quot;transluct&quot; when it passed through the light of the moon.It was 8:30 pm., mst, 3/13/97, and I wasgoing to bed. I went to close the window,when three huge, white, bright lights caughtmy eye. A plane was crashing from SkyHarbor Airport in Phoenix, the angle andspeed would not allow a plane to survive.I ran to the living room, grabbed my glasses,and told my wife of 25 years, Get outside,NOW! Never said that before, in that tone.We were standing on our porch within 8-10seconds. This craft was 3000 ft. off thesurface. at least 1 mile in length. Thereis no doubt in our minds that what we wereseeing, was one object. It appeared to betriangular or wedge shaped. Three bright whitebeams of light up front, and 4-5 solid, non-blinking red lights on east side and rear.The moon at that time was at 45 degrees anddirectly facing us. I told my wife, &quot;We&apos;llbe able to see detail as it passes in frontof us, directly in front of the moon. As thecraft passed thru the light of the moon, thecolor of the moon changed to dingy yellow,and we could see horizontal &quot;waves&quot; as itpassed. These waves were similar to gasolinefumes if one to take the lid off of a gas can,and look at the reflection of the fumes. Thecraft was viewed by us from a straight linenorth to south. It never moved irratically,nor did it make a sound. It was totally quiet.Our viewing sight was approximatly 2 milesfrom the craft. We witnessed a plane in landingformation pass right over the object. It neveradjusted its course. It didn&apos;t see it. I toldmy story to MUFON on 1-15-97. We were on,&quot;Strange Universe&quot; on 3/31/97 as witnesses tothis great event. The video on the news and tvis not what we saw at or near that same time.Our sighting was one solid object. We live inthe far eastern part of Chandler, and had anexcellent view point. This craft had no visiblemeans of propulsion and was totally quiet.Itnever changed course and went straight southtowards Tucson, Az. The object was dark andwas not big in height, but beyond huge inlength. We were back inside by 8:45 in totaldisbelief of what we had seen. It wasn&apos;t untilwe saw the news the next day, did we realizethat others had seen massive sightings. I am44 years old, married for 25 years, threegrown boys, and twin granddaughters, I am aUS Navy veteran, with 14 years education.

19970320	19970811	 Spencerville (Canada), ON	 light	45 minutes	Summary : Bright red-orange lightI was observing/photographing Hale-Bopp. I noticed a bright red-orange light, about 2x as bright as Venus at it&apos;s maximum at ~20 degrees over the NNW horizon. For some reason, I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it. After about 45 minutes, I saw that it was in the same position, and had not moved. I looked at it with my 11x80 binoculars (on a tripod) and it started to move (at about 1&quot;/second) steadily parallel to the horizon (eastward). I do not know the exact date, but it was sometime in March and I told a friend about it the next day. A few weeks later, several very bright orange lights were seen to the south all over Eastern Ontario. My friend saw them (I did not) and said that they were bright enough to cast a shadow - his wife and several neighbours watched them for a few minutes. The Ottawa Citizen newspaper had an article about them (with photos) a couple of days later and claimed that they were flares being tested as Fort Drum, USA (about 70 miles due south of this sighting). When my friend&apos;s wife phoned Fort Drum, she was told that the Canadian Government was testing flares near Prescott!! (approx. 20 miles south of the sighting). On Aug 6, ~2300 hrs, the sky was overcast but there was a clear band over the northern horizon. I saw the &apos;same&apos; object in the approximately the same position and went into the house to get my binoculars. When I came out, about a minute later, it was gone.

19970607	19970618	 St. Louis, MO	 cylinder	about 3 minutes	Summary : A long, finger-shaped, metal object hovered over the creek behind my house for several minutes.After my friend ((Name deleted)) and I finished watching a rerun of Seinfeld, we went outside for a smoke.  When we got outside, Gene pointed to a large object in the sky which hovered several yards above the trees in the creek behind my house.  It was about 300 feet long and was rounded at each end, sort of like a cigar or finger.  We just watched it for 2 or three minutes, and then it rose silently up a few feet and flew away almost instantaneously.  I have a bachelor&apos;s degree in teaching, specializing in modern American History.
19430601	19970704	 Nebraska, NE	 disk	10-20 min	Summary : My 94 yr. old grandmother, ((Name deleted)) described to me an encounter that occured in Nebraska in about 1943. She was driving in her car with her husband (my grandfather, a pilot and member of the barnstormers group &quot;The Victory Flyers&quot;, now deceased). They both saw a large glowing gold saucer that followed them for several miles in broad daylight before speeding away at a rate of speed never heard of or seen by either of them before. My grandfather who was familiar with all flying machines known at that time told  ((name deleted)) to never mention this to anyone even family, as they would undoubtably be considered &quot;crazy&quot;.((Name deleted)) finally told me of this sighting in 1980. It was passed on to the resurrected &quot;Project Blue Book&quot; based in Arkansas at the time but there was never any follow-up.This may be the earliest sighting in the USA. ((name deleted)) is still very sharp and able to give details of the sighting if anyone is interested in taking a report. She should be contacted since at 94 she may not be with us forever. Contact me if questions or help needed.(Name deleted.))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))
19970919	19971202	 Orland Park, IL	 rectangle	3-4 minutes	Summary : When pulling out of my driveway headed north I noticed a stationary bright white light above the west horizon which suddenly sped off traveling north. I turned east off the main road since there was another vehicle behind me in order to view the object. I was putting my car window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left and above me. It measured four to five palm breadths and was a metallic bronze color with a narrow nose/head and a short fan shaped tail.  It was relatively flat with a rectangular shape with two rows of red lights and two rows of blue lights on each side and a single row of red or blue lights on the tail.  It passed over in five to six seconds and no engine sound was heard.When pulling out of my driveway on 09/19/97 to go to work, I turned north onto West Ave. and stopped at the stop sign.  A bright white stationary light caught my eye which I thought was an airplane against the west horizon. I remained stopped at the sign because the light was so bright. As I watched it, it appeared to stop and start very quickly several times.  I pulled away from the stop sign when I saw another vehicle behind me only to see the object speed off faster than any plane goes traveling in the same direction as my car.  To view it better I decided to turn off the main road in an east direction, put my car in park, shut off the radio and was putting my automatic window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left of my car and above me.  Thinking this was the bright object I had seen, it would have been necessary for it to have made a sharp 45 degree angle in order for me to have seen it so quickly. It scared me tremendously and I remember reminding myself that there were other vehicles on the road at this time and I must not be the only one seeing this. With my car window down I was looking out to see the bright light but instead saw an aircraft that seemed unusual, rectangular in shape, large, ( it would have taken four to five palm breadths to cover the length) but not wide, (it would have taken one=half a palm breadths to  cover the width) It was a metallic bronze/chocolate color with a narrow head and fan shaped horizontal small tail compared to the large rectangular body.  No white light was visible and there was no sound made by the craft.  It seemed to move slowly above me taking five to six seconds  to pass and was not visible in the eastern horizon afterwards, however the area is densley populated with homes and large trees. I was afraid it was some type of military aircraft that had gotten off course and flying so low, I thought it would crash into the surrounding homes. Two rows of eight to twelve lights which were circular and not revolving or shining a beam were on each side of the craft. Each row was single in color and one row was red and the other blue but I cannot remember the sequence of the color.  The tail also had a row of either red or blue lights but were perpendicular to the craft and only five or six circular non-beaming lights.  The body of the craft was wider than the sides and angled down like a single step to the edges.  The lights were beneath each edge although I could not see the entire left edge of the craft. After it passed, I remember sitting in my car for several seconds wondering what it was and what I should do.  Not wanting to be late for work, I continued east on the side street to LaGrange Road thinking any aircraft that big and that low I would be able to see when I was past the trees and houses.  However, it was no where to be seen.  I went to work and returned home at approximately 1600  when I contacted the Federal Aviation Agency only to be told that most of their personnel had left for the day and they had no reports of unusual aircraft that day.  I contacted our local newspaper - The Daily Southtown - and asked about any reportings. They informed me they got their information from the local police and they had received none.  Not wanting any to think I was strange, I tried to find somewhere to report this without telling the police.  The local phone numbers for the UFO agency were disconnected.  Although I am reminded daily of the event, only today 12/02/97 did I find the phone number and web site for the National UFO Reporting Center due to a report in the Daily Southtown about another local sighting  of unusual lights two days ago.  I would like for someone to explain that what I saw was an experimental military aircraft or I would think perhaps others on their way to work may have seen the same thing I did.
19970810	19970820	 Bellingham, WA	 light	3 minutes	Summary : Saw a dim moving light.  Thought I was watching a satellite.  Yellow light flashed brilliantly, then faded to near invisibility.  It was a clear night and I was out to watch the Perseid meteor shower.I am a university teacher who has lived in Bellingham for 7 years.  I am interested in UFO phenomena, but have never seen anything unusual before.  On the evening of August 10, 1997, I was outside at 11:30 pm watching for shooting stars when I saw what I thought was a satellite.  It was very dim, almost invisible, and I only noticed it because of the faint movement.  As I watched, the &quot;satellite&quot; suddenly flashed a brilliant yellow light.  The original light in the sky was barely a pinprick, but the flash was as large as my pinky nail held at arms length.  After the flash, the &quot;satellite&quot; seemed to disappear.  I could then make out faint movement and a tiny pinprick of light and then the object flashed again.  It moved in an east-to-west trajectory and flashed about every ten seconds until it went out of my line of sight.  I estimate that I watched the object for approximately 2, maybe 3 minutes.  I went inside, through the house, to see if it was visible from my front porch! (I had been on my back deck).  It wasn&apos;t.  I wonder is anyone else has seen something similar?
19970609	19970609	 Monterey (north of), CA	 other	15 minutes	Summary : saw blue green bright flash covering entire horizen, then few miles down the road off of highway 1, saw two perfect circles of fire in a large field and one smaller fire in the distance.four friends and i were travelling at approximately 1:15 am on highway 1 about 10 miles north of monterey california.  all but one witnessed extremely large blue green flash on horizon that lit up the entire sky like lightning.a few miles down the highway and over some small hills, we encountered two almost perfect circles of fire in a large field on the eastern side of the highway. we did not see any structures nearby or any debris (as if from something that had crashed?) we witnessed two fire trucks going towards the fires a few miles further north, but after calling the monterey communications office, the dispatcher told us that he had no record of dispatching any type of emergency vehicles at the time in question.  please email me with any questions or information that you might have, as i am extrmely interested, as well as perplexed, by this incident. ((Name and address deleted)) all five passengers who witnessed these things are males between the ages of 22 and26 who are all college educated and of Mexican descent.
19970215	19971122	 La Puente, CA	 other	2.0 seconds	Summary : From a stand-still... to a one-second period of ignition... followed by one-second of what sounded like the after-burner of a massive- powered jet... then, silence.appologies for the un-sure-of exact date. This could have been a few months prior to the date stated above, or a few moths after. It was approximately 3:00am and myself, and two friends (brothers) were standing in front yard, talking before two of us departed to our homes.  All of a sudden, a noise sounded from the sky...a very solid-like sound which resembled that of a clothes dryer starting its first turn or two of the drum... but much, much more powerful and solid and what seemed like would be extremely loud...however, was shelled-like...retained to paremeters. This sound was approximately one-second in length.  Following this sound (as in sequence of process) was what sounded like a jets exhaust...however, much more determined-soundinding, and of much more power.   The duration of this sound was also approximately one-second. Reactions of all three of us were the same... which was turning our heads up to look in the direction of where these sounds came from and went to.  All three of our opinions of the directions were within the South to Southeast direction (in the sky) from where first started and took-off in the directoin of the sounds and headed in the direction (opinions) varying) somewhere in the South to South West direction.   I describe it as this&gt; Something was sitting in a dead-standstill position...in the sky and, was able to &quot;start&quot; (whatever it is that was started) and accelerate to speeds that enabled them to disappear (so-to- speak).
19970418	19970418	 Dallas, TX	 diamond	15 minutes	Summary : Looking East, saw bright red light descending down thru cloud layer, then back up into clouds,repeating twice. Red light had a diamond shaped craft around it. About 2 minutes later a high speed jet aircraft flew from south to nor that same altitude thru clouds as the red light but it was already gone.
19971029	19971031	 Childress (approx 20 miles north of, TX	 light	5-7 seconds	Summary : A bright light, which I thought was a &quot;falling star&quot;, suddenly leveled off at my altitude, veered to the north, then came directly at me, at very high speed.On the evening of October 29, 1997, I was flying my Cessna 170, at an altitude of 9,500 ft., and a heading of 060 degrees. (N.E.).  I was approx. 70 nautical miles S.W. of the Hobart VOR. on the 240 radial.  At around 1900 CST, I observed what I thought at first was a meteorite, and wondered why it didn&apos;t burn up like they usually do.  I remember saying to myself, &quot;Gosh, I could of made a wish on this one!&quot;  Then I thought it was going to make it all the way to the ground.  When it got to my altitude, it suddenly leveled off, veered slightly to the north, then turned and came directly at me, still at what I, out of lack of a better term, will call &quot;meteorite speed&quot;.  I was in awe, and remember thinking, &quot;nothing travels that fast!!!&quot; After a few seconds in awe, I was terror stricken, as I realized the object was on a direct collision course. My reflex reaction made me bank the plane 90 degrees, and pull back hard to avoid collision. (As if my 120 mph airplane could possibly avoid something that fast!?)  When there was no impact, or wake, or anything else, I turned around to see what it was, but it was gone.  I immediately went for my charts to find the frequency to call ATC on, to see if they had painted a target, but was so upset, and shaking, I couldn&apos;t look at my chart and fly the plane at the same time.  As for the size, and relative speed of the object, I can only make an analogy.  I have already compared it to a meteorite.  Assuming a meteorite appears about the size of a kernel of corn, held at arms length, then this object went from that size, when I first observed it, to about the size of a beach ball, held at arms length, when I maneuvered abruptly to &quot;avoid it&quot;. I am a commercial pilot with ten years, and several thousand flight hours of experience, and am certainly used to seeing lights in the sky, and judging their speed and altitude, for collision avoidance. I live near an Air Force base, and am used to seeing, and sharing the airspace with military aircraft.   I can say with certainty, nothing the military has, goes that fast.      If anyone wants to check the radar tapes, my transponder was on all the way, so there should be a good plot of my course.   I departed Roswell, N. M., at approx. 16:00 mountain time.   The tower at ROW will have a log with the exact time.   My aircraft call sign is N((Numbers))A.
19971016	19971016	 Hollister, CA	 light	40 seconds	Summary : Very dim light, extreme altatude, traveling from Pacific easterly aprox. over San Jose or S.F., dramatic turn to south/east toward Arazona or New Mexico, extreme speed, no heat trail, shape unknown due to altitude.Object was at such altatude that size and distance are difficult to estimate.  Object was spec of white light.  Came from Pacific Ocean to the west, traveling east at extreme speed!  Aprox. over central valley object stopped and then sped south/east in direction of southern California or Arazona. Duration was about 40 seconds. No sound, not aircraft, appeared high enough to be just outside of atnosphire, like a sattlelight except for the speed and dramatic direction change. PLEASE TELL ME IF ANYONE ELSE IN CALIF. SAW THIS, OR IF THERE WERE SIGHTINGS SOUTH OF HOLLISTER SHORTLY AFTER 1905????
19970411	19970414	 Monreal (Canada), PQ	 disk	40 seconds	Summary : two seperate UFO sightings, moments apartTwo students, myself and my friend, were on the roof of an apartments building at 2:30 am and witnessedthree classically saucer-shaped things flying over the city. Moments after we noteced them, they seemedto turn on a 45 degree angle and dissapear. About 30 seconds later we saw what looked like one of theseobjects, only a fair size bigger and further away. WE lost sight of it when it moved behind a building.A minute or so later, we saw six more, much much closer, seemingly flying in a V formation. They tooturned on an angle and seemed to dissapear. They seemed to glow white light. Both myself and my friendor good students, and reliable sources.I will fill my new address in the Witness contact Info area, as I am moving on the 1st of May.
19970704	19970708	 Frontenac, MO	 light	5 seconds	Summary : A streak of greenish and white light across the skyMy wife and I and some family members were out side enjoying a BBQ. We were on our deck when all of the sudden a bright  bright! light streaked across the sky just above us the first thing we all said was that was a ufo. I have never seen anything like it in my life it was a bright greenish cigar shaped light with a thin streak of white light behind it. The one thing we all noticed was how strait and steady it was as strait as could possibly be. There was no sound at all. The object seemed to be moving at the speed of light. It sent chills through me as I saw it and my wife and sister. We all believe this was without a dought a ufo. We were watching the local St.Louis News and heard that other people saw the same thing some distense away.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness means an evening sighting.  We have changed the time here.  PD))
19580520	19970817	 North Hollywood, CA	 sphere	1 week	Summary : I was four years old. I would visit at my grandmothers house. she lived in north hollywood . I was playing in the front yard when a ball like object slowly came down from the sky. it was the size of a baseball.I was sitting on the grass when i looked up above the parking lot across the street in front of my grandmother&apos;s house. in the sky was a dot. i could barely see it . it caught my attention. as I sat there it came a little closer. I still could not see it clearly.I went inside for lunch. I came back out and it was still there about 75 to 90 feet away. I sat on the driveway and stared at it. it was neat.there it stayed all day.the next day I looked up and was looking for it interested and curious.it came back and got closer. the object came up to me only 2 feet from me.  I tried to touch it but I would move just out of my reach.it stayed all week and left as it arived.it was clear yet solid it would be constantly changing its surface like clouds and solids interfacing it reacted to me and communicated with me. it was like unconditional love. it taught me and gave me great intellegence and insight. I was tested a few years ago with a i.q. of 196. I have gifts I cant explain. I wonder if anyone has had similar experierces?
19970623	19971008	 Willow Creek Campground, CA	 other	2 hrs	Summary : Late in the evening, just before retiring, A luminous object was spotted just above a mountain, and in between two trees. It appeared to be one mile to the south/southeast of the campground. It remained &apos;flickering&apos; in a cross pattern, until I signaled with a flashlight, which caused it to abruptly change its pattern and speed; changing its location extremely quickly. and then coming back to its original spot and remain flickering once again. just above the mountain.The object appeared to be of a spherical shape, maybe 15-20ft across, from where it was observed. The object &apos;flickered&apos; rapidly and it moved in a tight, &apos;tic tac toe&apos; like movement, intensifying in luminensce as it moved. After 30 min. object was &apos;signaled&apos; with a small flashlight, to which the object reacted by flashing brighter and moving even more erratically; much faster and farther. After, it would come back to its original position. There were no changes in color,as far as the light is concerned. I watched for about 2 hrs until I became extremely tired, even though I was very interested, and slept.

19670801	19970705	 Downey (North American Aviation), CA		several minutes	Summary : Light in sky with amazing accelleration properties.The Plastics Pattern Shop -- I was with several workers working outside because of the dust at night abrating plastic layup tools used to produce ablative structures for the Apollo Space Craft. One fellow pointed at a bright &quot;star&quot; approaching from the east (like Las Vegas). He felt it was unusual and we all watched. It was not a helicopter although it moved at about that speed. It hovered over Downey (probably more like La Mirada) for a few minutes. Then it took off on a new coarse (NW - like Point Mugu). We were all sure that it was not a plane. The curious thing is that the arc it described on the sky seemed to maintain a constant speed as it approached the horizon. That is, there was none of the normal &quot;gradual loss of motion due to the distance&quot; that one normally experiences. It was really booking!That&apos;s all folks!Sorry - no green women with galactic eyes and no abductions.But hey! a UFO is a UFO, right!
19970606	19970630	 Spain,	 changing	10 min.	Riding on a train in the middle of nowhere in Spain. With my travelling companion.  We are both 19 yrs. old, taking a 6 week trip to Europebefore going starting College in the fall.2 other young men were riding in the samecar with us.  The rest of the train was dark,everyone asleep.It/they appeared 5 feet from the trainwindow. The size was about 25-30 feet accross .It hoverednear to our car for 10 min., going from onewindow to another,changing from a circularshape, to an eliptical, to a square.Could have been one spaceship, or severalin a formation.  There were several lights,in a circular formation at first, allspinning.  The sky was red during thewhole time. When we went through a tunnellit disapeared, then was back when we emergedfrom the tunnell. At first there was oneship/formation. Then there were two. We didnot report this incident to anyone.We have no previous experience with UFO&apos;s.We did not want to have this type of experience.Most people do not believe us.  All 4 of ussaw the exact same thing. We were alal absolutelypositive that this was a spaceship/spaceships.
19971025	19971025	 Minneapolis, MN	 triangle	1 minute	Summary : A small V of lights moving very quickly from west to eastThe lights were small and round, like Christmas lights. The V was moving East to West, leading with the point. The lights were white, close to each other, and there were about 12-15 lights on each side of the V. It looked very far away, the shape was very small and the lights were quite dim. It was moving extremly fast, in less than a minute it was out of sight.
19970313	19970318	 Phoenix (Ahwatukee), AZ	 triangle	10 min	Summary : Sighted red to white horizontal line on the north west horizon. As the object got closer it looked like a 5 light triangle. It passed over head and diasppeared into the south east horizon in about 10 to 15 minutes.The object was first spoted by ((name deleted)) at approximately 2015 on 3/13/97.  The object was seen on the northwestern horizon.  It appeared as a horizontal line with a red glow.  We arrived home and got some binoculars to see what it was.By this time it had changed color to a brilliant white and was in the shape of a triangle.  The best discription at this time was the leading edge of the B2 bomber.  A light on the nose, one on either side and toward the back, then one moreon either side spaced farther back than the first pair.  There were five lights in all.  The object moved from the northwest to the southeast, almost directly over head of our house.  As it moved across the sky is believe I was able to seethe stars between the light formation.  We tried to hear a sound from the objects, thinking it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no strobe or red and green marker lights.  The formation of the five objects did not changeas you would expect from aircraft.  There was no change in spacing, no noise and it was as bright overhead as it was comming or going.  We could not tell how high the objects were, but while discussing what we saw the next day we realized thatwe might have see these objects while they were over Prescott because they started out red then changed to white while over Phoenix.  We do not have any explanation for what we saw, but we both saw something we&apos;ve never seen before.
19961113	19971022	 Harrisburg (just outside of), PA	 light	4 minutes	Summary : Flew around in sky then flew off in westerly direction.On the date specified above a small glowing light flew across the sky in a &quot;zig-zag&quot; pattern. This light was not blinking which eliminates the possibility of an airplane, nor did it fly in a straight line so it was not a satellite.  The light flew around for a few minutes then flew off in a westerly direction.
19970704	19970708	 Dupo, IL	 light	10 seconds	Summary : Flying object beamed a large blue light across the ground as the object moved from south to north .  We were directly in the path of the beam and looked up into it as it illuminated us.During 4th of July family fireworks, a large, low-flying object (could have been an airplane) with bright red lights on it, beamed a large, very bright blue light down on the ground directly under the object.  Our family was directly in the path and as we were all illuminated blue, we looked up into the light.  It moved off towards the woods north of the house and the light was turned off.  Two of us saw it go off just before it would have gotten to the woods.  We all discussed this strange happening at length.  The object came from the direction of Columbia, IL and moved off north towards Cahokia, IL.  Our sighting was two miles east of Dupo, IL on Imbs Station Road, about 3/4 mile west of the intersection of Imbs Station Road and Triple Lakes Road.  Observers were:  my retired parents, two sisters-in-law (one is the wife of a US Air Force Colonel--the Colonel was lighting fireworks and did not see the light), my sister, myself, and several nieces and nephews.
19970711	19970714	 Allison Park (Hampton Twp.), PA	 cylinder	6 min.	Summary : As I was driving near the site of a radio tower under construction, I noticed a black, barrel shaped object hovering near it. I stopped my vehicle and tried to understand what it was. As I watched, it began to change shapes, and flash as if the entire unit was a strobe light. I am a former member of the Civil Air Patrol (1Lt.) and I am very familiar with small aircraft, and this was unlike anything I have ever seen. The craft seemed to be observing the construction of the communications tower. Traffic began to build behind me and I had to move to another location 20 seconds away, however, after I moved it was gone. No aircraft I have ever seen from this elevated view point can move out of the field of view so quickly.I live in Allison Park in Hampton Twp., about 12 miles North of the city of Pittsburgh PA. On Friday July 11 1997, I was on my way home at 3:25 PM. I entered the northern end of Topnic Dr.(in Hampton Twp) and from its high elevation I looked to see how much progress was made on the new communications tower being built near the township Municipal building and as I made the turn onto Topnic I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. Looking due south, I saw the tower first. It was not far from being topped off. I could barely see the men working on the top section, but just off to the right, or to the west, there was a black object hovering, as if observing the tower. It was about 1500 above the ground and about 1/2 mile away from me and was so black it was if I was looking at a hole in the sky. It was sort of barrel shaped, and as I watched it hovering completly silent and motionless, it began to change shapes. It changed so many times that I could no longer tell what shape it wa! s. It then began to flash as if the entire craft was a strobe light, pulsing about every 2 seconds. I could see no detail in the craft, no lights or windows, just a black object in the sky hovering silently motionless at first, and then suddenly changing shapes, and flashing like a giant strobe light. I am a mature adult man, with years of experience in the USAF Civil Air Patrol. I live within the TCA of Pittsburgh International Airport, and I&apos;m used to seeing aircraft of military, commercial, and private origin flying in the area. I have never in my life, however, seen anything that I can even say comes close to looking like the craft that I saw on 11 July 1997. My vehicle was stopped in the middle of the road as I observed this craft, and a few cars started to build up behind me. I moved on down the road where I lost sight of it for 20 seconds. When I got to another vantage point, it was gone. From the elevation that I was at, no aircraft, balloon, or helicopter could have moved out of my field of view so quickly. I never heard of any other witnesses, but would like to know, if anybody out there can tell me, if there were any other reports of this sighting. I didn&apos;t report this to anyone, because I didn&apos;t know who to report it to.
19970523	19970730	 Arcadia (outskirts of), FL	 light	3 minutes	Summary : Me and my friend were traveling down I-75 towards Arcadia, Fl. when we saw a very bright pulsating white light hovering in a clearing, after we passed it going 70 mph it began to follow us traveling just above the treeline, even after we went over a hill it still was behind us. It was blinking slower than an aircraft strobe light so I know that it was&apos;nt any type of airplane, especially because there was no visible wings or fuselage. The light was so bright that it was lighting up the sky all around it. I followed for about 3 minutes and than quickly acclerated towards a small town and disappeared. Me and my friend who are both college students, I am 21 he is 25 were traveling down I-75 northbound towards Arcadia, Fl on the way to a camping trip, it was early Saturday at about 4:00 am when we saw a very bright pulsating white light hovering in a clearing, after we passed it going 70 mph it began it rise up and began to follow us traveling just above the treeline,there was no smoke trail or any sign of a purpolsion sytem. It seemed to be only a couple of feet in diameter, with no discernable shape. Throughout the entire sighting it kept at the exact same distance on the other side of the Interstate heading towards the oncoming traffic, even after we went over a hill it still was behind us. It was blinking slower than an aircraft strobe light so I know that it was&apos;nt any type of airplane, especially because there was no visible wings or fuselage. The light was so bright that it was lighting up the sky all around it. I followed for about 3 minutes and than quickly acclera! ted towards a small town and disappeared.
19970313	19970428	 Phoenix (Tempe), AZ	 light	7 min.	Summary : 5 orange colored lights fall toward earth like fireworks.  Shortly after they hovered in place, pulsating and began moving at odd trajectories.  They did this for several minutes, blinking in and out.  Moments later, they had vanished from view.Driving Northbound on West I-10, from the Chandler Blvd exit, Miles looked out the car windshield and noticed the objects positioned at one o&apos;clock. As they were falling, I noticed five objects, three with sparks coming off of them.  Then I got Demian&apos;s attention and we both witnessed them stop above the horizon of the city lights, hover, and began pulsating.  Two, started moving independantly of the others at various right angles and spiral motions, while the others maintained a steady pattern.By this point we had passed the Elliot Rd. offramp and were proceeding toward the Superstition Freeway.  By the time we had crossed beneath the Guadalupe Rd. overpass, they had vanished from sight.  From our assumption, they appeared to be East of Sky Harbor by a few miles, somewhere over Tempe.There is not a dought in our minds that this unexplained phenominon is indeed explainable.  For the record, this report was typed prior to reviewing the posted repots..

19971114	19971117	 Dallas/Ft Worth (Approaching), TX	 formation	35-45 mins	Summary : Saw strange lights above high clouds from an American Airlines flight into Dallas Ft WorthI am writing you because of something I saw (along with a friend) while flying into Dallas Friday evening. The more I have thought about this the more I knew I should write down what I saw. &nbsp; I was flying from Seattle to Dallas on Flight 18 Friday Nov. 14th. At about 6:35-6:45 P.M. Dallas time, about a half hour out of Dallas/Ft Worth we were high above thick cloud cover. There was a full moon out and the clarity above the clouds was good. As we looked out ahead and to the east (port side of the aircraft), I noticed few lights out ahead of us. I presumed they were other aircraft coming right at us since the lights did not blink like wing lights but as the head lights do at times. There were two such lights and they looked far off but being at night it was hard to tell just how far. I watched for a long time watching other aircraft with blinking strobe lights passing in various directions. these lights (the identifiable aircraft with blinkers) were much smaller in size to the constant lights. What started to seem strange was the fact that the original two lights which were constant began to appear to be closer the nearer we flew, not farther apart as it should be is! we were approaching them. Also what seemed strange was the fact that at no point did there appear any other lights such as a green (starboard) or red (port) lights with these two constant lights. I watched intently as I saw a normally lit and identifiable aircraft fly perpendicular to the main light on my left that I had been watching. The identifiable aircraft approached extremely close and behind this light. The light was not a distant star or light on a hill or a beacon as my mind raced to start to explain what I was seeing. &nbsp; The time span now is maybe 15 full minutes of watching these lights. We were approaching these lights which was apparent since the lights were now directly to the port side of the aircraft and no longer in front of us. As we continued on, and our approach to Dallas caused as to slightly alter our approach, these lights became directly to port from us and even closer and seemed to rise higher above the cloud layer than before. I had mentioned the lights to my companion several times since I first spotted them when I had described them first as two aircraft with their&nbsp; headlights on. At this point I saw a third light low in the cloud cover below these two lights. This third light was hazy as if slightly in the clouds and also seemed larger and closer to us. It had shape to it, almost like it was like a soft cube shape (a cube with rounded corners and puffed up sides. It was not just light). I was seriously questioning that these lights were anything I had seen before. I had made! several comments to my friend trying to explain what I was seeing since I knew they were not aircraft like &quot;these have to be beacon lights&quot; or &quot;maybe they are power lines&quot; always to be followed by, &quot;but we are too high for that&quot;. &nbsp; I said to my companion that she should look at the lights. Right about then, I leaned back as we passed the lights. My companion leaned over me and looked now back slightly aft and to port through the windows and said to me &quot;You mean those lights that look like a triangle?&quot;. I looked out the window again and now saw that indeed there was three distinct lights, not blinking above the cloud cover in a triangle formation. The third light had indeed come out and was well above the clouds. &nbsp; As we continued to move towards Dallas and begin our decent, the lights remained in a triangle formation eventhough we continued make a left turn towards the Dallas/Ft Worth airport. In other words, even thought they were in a triangular formation while we looked at them to port, they remained in a triangular formation as we viewed them to aft. &nbsp; Within a few minutes we were descending into the clouds and I lost sight of the lights. &nbsp; I have thought a lot about what I saw and discussed it with my companion who also saw them. These were stationary lights at our altitude during normal flight approach about 35-45 mins out of Dallas or slightly higher (with the exception to the third light) which would put them at&nbsp; least 25-35K feet. The lights were stationary since while we approached they were in front, as we continued they were to the port and then aft of us as we passed. There were initially two constant lights very far apart when first viewed and only slightly brighter and very much closer to each other 30 minutes later when joined by the third light from the clouds. the lights did not seem to move but were stationary though they must have moved since they were closer to each other after viewing them for 30 minutes than at first. &nbsp; I am a 42 yr old businessman in Seattle (your town). I work as a real estate broker. I was a concert promoter for many many years and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles. I have a good grasp of astronomy and can identify the moons of Jupiter with my binoculars and Venus along with my favorite constellations. I grew up with a pilot as y best friend and have logged hundreds of right seat flying in small aircraft so I have an appreciation for what aircraft look like at night and during the day. &nbsp; Though I do listen to Art Bell and have read many books on Roswell and a few about other UFO&apos;s, I am not a &quot;believer&quot;. I am a curious observer. With thousand s of hours of staring at the skies, of flying all over this country many times over during night and day, I have never seen anything that wasn&apos;t identifiable, at least after 5-10 minutes of viewing. These objects were viewed by me for nearly 45 minutes non-stop and I have no explanation that meets any test I put to it. I have replayed the tape in my head over and over. I keep seeing the aircraft passing behind the main left light. I keep seeing the two lights far apart and them seeing the triangle shape after the appearance of the third. I see the third boxy light shrouded ion the clouds then see it clearly in view above the clouds. These objects had to be moving, but in such a way that they seemed stationary. There were no additional lights associated with these white lights. there were no strobes with these lights. Whil! e other aircraft came and went from Dallas and appeared across the sky, these lights seemed to sit still. &nbsp; I had to finally admit I saw something strange and unexplainable with my resources. I guess in a way, I wanted to live in denial that I saw anything weird at all, but in the end, had to write this down and send it off as a statement of my very best recollection of what I saw. &nbsp; My companion is a person who works for the airline, does not wish to be involved but has flown extensively for the last 5 years in her porfession

19970704	19970708	 Brighton, IL	 light	10 seconds	Summary : While shooting fireworks, saw a bright blue object move horizontilly from east to west across the field in the back of the house.As we were shooting fireworks at 9:45pm on  july 4th, we saw a electric blue object with a bright white core move horizontally from east to west.  The light came from over the trees to the east and moved  to the southwest diaginally to the west.  At first we thought it was a shooting star, but later we learned there were reports of similar objects seen in the area.  The object was about the size of a soccer ball and was electric blue around the core. It looked to be about 100&apos; above the gound and was visible for about 600 or 700 ft. and then suddenly disappeared.. The total time visable to us was 5 to 7 seconds.  There was no noise associated with the sighting..  There was only one object observed.  The observers are between 47 and 54 years old and business owners.  We have never seen anything like this.  We are not under medication  or have not been treated for mental illness and both witnessed the same thing..
19971104	19971105	 Seattle, WA	 light	1to2 seconds	Summary : Seen in the SE sky over chuch, bright light too big to be a star,it was complety still. then in split second disappaered going SW at speeds too fast for planes.I am a Straightedge christian male.
19970620	19970621	 Carefree, AZ	 circle	5 seconds	Summary : Large round object glowing a bright green, with also some yellow &amp; white light dropping to the NE from SW, to near ground level at about a 45 degree angle &amp; dissapeared behind the north side of Black Mountain.This was NOT a meteorite.  I&apos;m an amateur astonomer. Every meteorite I have ever seen was always white never any color, a small point of light, and faster and higher elevation than this object.  The color was a failrly brilliant (almost neon) light green, it had lesser shades of yellow and white.  It seemed like I could actually see a round object rather than the normal point of light.  It was geading toward earth at a 45% angle.  There is no way it could have burned-up as it was near ground level when it dissapeared to the NE behind Black Mountain.  It was the same size and light intensity when first viewed high up in the sky.  There was an alomost full moon at the time and the sky was still somewhat light from the sunset so it&apos;s even more amazing how bright and visible this object was, as the sky was far from dark at the time.By the way, I also witnessed the UFO&apos;s near Phoenix on 3-13-97 which I never reported until now.They were due south of here, I would estimate directly over Phoenix.  It&apos;s dark sky here as there is no city lights in this rural area 30-miles north of downtown Phoenix, but bright city lights in Phoenix may explain explain why my view was so good. Plus, I am elevated here at 2,600 foot level, on the slope of Black Mountain.  My wife and I observed the 3-13-97 objects for about 20 to 30-minutes.  They were in a quarter-circle formation with 5 objects to the right and 1 object to the left of center and seperated somewhat from the other five. They were much larger than a star or airplane lights.  The were round and glowing a steady white light.  They were heading very slowly from west to east, almost hovering in the sky and just barely moving.  They did not lose any altitude at all.  This eliminates them being flares or baloons like I heard the military said they may have been.  Plus they were flying in a well defined and steady geometrical formation. After about 15-minutes som!e of the objects simply starteddisappearing, almost light they turned their lights off.  After 10 to 30-minutes they all seemed to have disappeared from view.  It&apos;s not like they moved out of sight, butb they seemed to have simply &quot;blinked-off&quot;.  There is no way they could be airplanes, far too slow and almost stationary.  They could not be flares as they lost no altitude at all during the entire time.  Plus, I believe they were close enough to make out the object, rather than just a point of light.  They were all equal size round white objects, except the on to the left of center was seperated from th others and may have been a little larger than the other five to the right of center.  All six were flying in a quarter circle formation and curved in a perfect geometrical arch.There is no other explanation for this than UFO&apos;s.  Being an amateur astonomet I view the night sky all the time and have never seen anything like my sightings of March 13 and June 20, 1997.My wife also witnessed the 3-13 sighting and her version is exactly the same as mine.
0000	19971106	 Brentwood (Long Island), NY		unknown	Summary : My neighbor said I disapeared of the front stoop of my house,There was a day during the summer in the mid 60&apos;s when my dad called me over while he was talking to our neighbor across the street. My father said that my neighbor, ((Name deleted)), was telling him that he was upset over the fact that I literally disappeared from off my front stoop. I stood there and looked at him.  How could I have disappeared off of my stoop??  I told him that things like that do not happen. He said it did. He said he was working in his yard, he saw me sitting on the stoop,  he turned his head for a second, and when he looked back I was gone.  I said he must have been mistaken. I said I must have gone into the house.  He said that there was not enough time..he said he just looked away for a second. He was really upset about it. I dismissed the entire thing as something he THOUGHT he saw,  and forgot about it.  Who ever heard of abductions during the &apos;60&apos;s. We had sightings, but that was about it. Many years have passed and now the UFO information we have has grown and opened up many new avenues of thought.  One of these is abductions. As I was first learning about this during the early &apos;90&apos;s, I suddenly had a flashback to that conversation in the street with my dad and our neighbor. But I had no memory of any abduction..I still don&apos;t.  But what I do have is a very strange memory puzzle that fits together..and it has to do with me being on my front stoop. When I put put these three pieces together, I came up with this strange story.  Piece one had to do with me sitting on my front stoop. I saw a light coming from out of the north headed in my general direction. I thought it was a jet. To think about it now why didn&apos;t I see the body of the jet..it was broad daylight on a summer afternoon. I watched the light seem to slow down and suddenly shoot off to the east. I remember saying..wow,  a ufo. That was the first piece of memory I have had floating in my head. The second was a memory of me being on the stoop,  and suddenly I felt like absolute garbage.  I was nausious and felt a little dizzy.  I had no clue what was wrong. I tried to get up.  I figured I would go lie down on the patio lounge.  As I got up I felt worse..I was completely disoriented. I staggered towards the gate to go into my back yard and wound up in the garage standing by my bike wondering what was the matter with me.  I finally made it to the lounge, and I remember my mother telling me later that I slept for about two hours or so. IF..these pieces belong together, the picture looks like this.  I was on the stoop.  I saw the UFO coming. It slowed down.  I was grabbed and my neighbor witnessed it even though he looked away for a second.  I was returned, saw the UFO leave..and then the sick disorientation set in. From there I walked in a disoriented state, from my stoop..to the garage..to the lounge chair and slept for hours. I now know that this has been going on in my life since the mid &apos;50&apos;s.  As a child I had little people in my room that would advance toward my bed...and that was all I remember. I have had visitors in my teens and adult life. I have managed to pull all of these memories that have been floating in my head for years as undefined strange events,  together to make sense of it all.  The only one I did not understand until fairly recently, was the inner nagging drive to study a particular topic. I had no idea why,  since I was 5 or so, that I had to study this topic. The information did not appear in my life until my early 20&apos;s. It continued in dribs and drabs straight to today. All of this info is on my 20 page web site. http://www.((address deleted)).HTM That&apos;s my story.
19920402	19970707	 Pebble Beach, CA	 light	15-20 seconds	Summary : A green light was iluminating the ocean as we drove past-suddenly, a white light came out of the water and straight for our car. The light came up to my window and I screamed, my mom (the driver) hit the gas and the light stayed with us for about 10 seconds then retreated back into the water.My mother is a nurse, I am a college student. Our family very upstanding in the community, PTA parents, my dad coaches Little League, I have 3 brothers, we are all conservative and skeptical, typical Republicans. My mother is especially rigid due to her profession, but what we saw was undeniable. My mom and I were driving along 17 Mile Drive about 22:05 one evening and we were perplexed by this glowing green light off the coast near Spanish Bay beach. We thought it might be shrimp boats(shrimpers fish usually in the middle of the night &amp; use irridescent green lights to attract the shrimp to the surface) but there were no boats on the surface of the water and the green area was far larger than shrimper lights. Plus, shrimpers as well as other fishermen do not usually fish off the coast of Pebble Beach,it is exclusive &amp; private. We kept driving, away from Spanish Bay, until we reached the Lodge. The green light was out of our sight as we entered the forest area. We were turnin! g to go home when I said, &quot;That light was just too weird, lets go see if it&apos;s still there.&quot; My mom was scared but we turned around and headed back towards Spanish Bay. About 22:18 the green light came back into view, underwater illumination that from a distance appeared to be a dome shaped structure laying on the floor of the ocean. We speculated that it was the lost city of Atlantis, it was really creepy, we were the only car on the road and we were both overwhelmed with a desire to turn around and head away from the scene. We continud a bit further, then we flipped a U-turn and began in the opposite direction again(I was  the passenger, with my side of the car facing the ocean at this point) Just as we accelerated to go, I looked out my window at the green dome, and this bright light beam shot out of the water and came directly to my window. I screamed and my mom hit the gas. We were going 81-85 miles per hour for about 10 seconds and the beam continued to shine in my window! , it&apos;s origin still the green dome under the water. I kept screaming and tried to climb into my mothers seat to escape the light, and suddenly the beam retreated back the way it came until it was back in the dome and disappeared. There was noise of some sort, like ringing at an almost inaudibly high pitch when the light was present, then it was gone when the beam retreated. We were both in shock, my mom drove home and I don&apos;t remember very much except talking to Pebble Beach Secirity with my parents later that night. I was severely disturbed by the incident, I couldn&apos;t sleep for about a week, and even then I slept in the same room as my parents. At the time of  this incident I was a senior in high school. I have since recovered, but I still have flashbacks. Needless to say I am now a firm believer in UFO&apos;s, as is my mother.
19971207	19971217	 Ashland (right over Highway 63), MO	 triangle	1 minute	Summary : Triangle shaped object with lights on each corner. Bright strobe lights leading in direction it was going. Going very slow and then stopped and hovered about 300 ft in air.Driving back to Jeff City, MO in early morning. Saw object with what looked like bright headlight. Going very slow and kinda turning towards my direction. Thought it was a plane. Started heading towards my left. As I got parallel with it I noticed it was hovering about 300 ft. in the air.  It was triangle shaped with orange lights at each corner. Thought it was a plane so I continued on but then I thought about it and I realized that only Harriers hover I thought.  I thought it coulda been a stealth, but I don&apos;t think they hover either. I turned around to go back and look, but it was gone.. oh well.  I am a distributor of a newspaper in the area and I was on my way back to JC to distribute it.  I do the newspaper thing because I can&apos;t find an attorney job at the moment.

19920615	19971014	 Jacksonville, FL	 formation	3 min	Summary : An very similar sighting to the one reported over Phoenix this year happened over Jacksonville in 1992.On the early morning of June 15, 1992 while lounging in a swimming pool with my cousin and father,  my cousin first noted seeing the formation.  He gasped in disbelief when he (we) saw an approaching string of large white lights coming at us from the west heading to the east directly over the city of Jacksonville FL.  The row of lights (7 or 8) were evenly spaced and at the same hieght.  As they approached us they went straight up into the sky and while going up formed the shape of a large &quot;V&quot;.  The &quot;V&quot; continued to go straight up into the sky until it was almost completed out of sight when a flash of light from either the horizon or ground shot up at the formation in an waverly line followed by a second streak of light.  We all sat there dumbfounded by the sighting.  My cousin who is a pilot stated that the light formation was not that of any plane over the US. and the entire time the formation made no heard sound. We all three never really pushed the issue until I had seen film footage of the sighting over Phoenix this year and what was filmed was almost exactly what we had seen.  Now I believe.

19881015	19970707	 Missouri (rural; location unspecified), MO			It was Oct. of 1988 (unsure of the dates) about eight o&apos;clock or a little later, that I was going to visit a friend. I pulled up into the driveway. (This is a very rural area in Missouri.) I went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friends house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were either three or five of them I don&apos;t really recall) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing towards the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned towards the blimp. It seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so.  I&apos;m just guessing. There was dead silence. I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the windalone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or seem to veer from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o&apos;clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience. The first line of the news cast said  &quot; If you saw it, you weren&apos;t the only one.&quot; They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night.  An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientiststhinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the day following the official report came back. It was a Russian Rocket that was reentering  the earths atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations.  For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way.  It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp. I would have believed this before any of the other explanations, At least, before It had been reported seen in seven different states that night. But after hearing this. I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skiesthat night.
19970703	19970801	 Brentwood, TN	 cylinder	6 seconds	Summary : Extremely bright white cylinder looking object east to west direction saw from horizon to horizon through treesI was getting out of my hot tub, and had closed the cover at 0:300 hours on 07/03/97, looked up and saw extremely bright white cylinder traveling at a hight rate of speed. It was traveling in a very slight south east to north west direction..I own a compass. I first saw the object at the far southeast horizon through the trees. It was flying extremely low and seemed to pass over the subdivision I live in. I heard no noise what so ever. The best way to describe the size is if you hold a regluar size pencil at arms length, then it would be about that size looking at it from a distance. Called the local police to see if any strange thing had been reported. They said no. Called the airport control tower at Nashville, Tn (Brentwood is next to Nashville and I live about three miles from the Davidson (Nashville) county line. Talked to a controller, he said the only thing they had was a life flight helicopter coming in from the north. I made a official report with the controller. My! house is in a very quiet neighbor hood. Planes can be seen on approach patterns from various view points from my house. Some far some fairly close. Hot air ballons and civilian and military helicopters sometimes pass over the neighbor hood. In talking about this sighting with different people, I found that others had seen similiar lights between 22:00 and 23:00 on 06/27/97. Two people were witnesses This sighting was reported as very high and seeing only the bright white cylinder shape.The speed was reported as faster than an airplane at the same height.  The same object was seen at a lower altitude by three women at 02:00 hours on 06/28/97, about 7 miles distance from the 06/27/97 sighting. The speed was reported as being extremely fast.
19970219	19970421	 Guadelupe, AZ		10 sec.	Caller was standing outside with 2 friends in town of Guadelupe, AZ.  He witnessed in the western sky what appeared to be a very bright light approaching directly toward them. Quite abruptly, the light, which was unblinking  and very bright, executed what appeared to be a 90 degree turn to the north.  It appeared to slow a bit, it dimmed, and then it simply extinguished.  When it turned, the intensity of the light did not appear to change. The color of the light was white, and it was noticably brighter than a planet in night sky.

When I did, I noticed two boomerang shaped craft, that appeared to be shiny metallic objects. they were about 2 miles away and were just over the top of the mountain at about 10,000 feet.  They were making circles.  They would go up very fast to about 20,000 feet, then disappear. Then they would return. I went inside and got my telescope and they almost looked ( unreal). This went on for 2+ hours, and they made no sound. I was a police officer, and have be in the marines, and have never seen anything like this. I have had stealth&apos;s and F1-111&apos;s from Holloman fly over, but nothing like this.  I had other strange things happen out there, but will not discuss over the net.

Lights were shaped like &quot;V&quot; &apos;s. Formation was also a VThe summary covers everything. The lights were dim and reddish. It made no sound. I only saw it for a few seconds ( less than five seconds ). I was in town, not in the country, the night sky was clear. It moved more or less from West to East.  Don&apos;t know what it was, but I thought I was important enough to report. I don&apos;t know how high in the sky it was. I was in my back yard. I am not obsessed with UFO&apos;s or anything, I just saw something odd and was wondering if anyone else saw it.
19971114	19971116	 Oakland, CA	 disk	15 min	Summary : Saw hovering craft above SF Bay Area above Oakland Coliseum area.  Craft was saucer like from what we could see.  The top was unlit and dark so it was hard to tell what the top looked like.  The bottom part of the craft was bowl shaped with many lights like flood lamps.  They were evenly spaced and looked&apos; like there were hundreds of them.  The craft was not a blimp because it was hovering motionless for a few minutes then rose about 100 feet very quickly within seconds.  It also dropped very rapidly in a straight vertical plane.  It was not affected by wind and stayed motionless in the same location for several minutes there were two such craft and a number of other craft circling in the area.I am a scientist and work for ((Name deleted))r Corporation as a Project Manager.  My wife ((Name deleted)) and her two sons ((Name deleted)) 12 years old,((Name deleted)) 9 years old, and my son ((name deleted)) 3 years old were all present in the car as we drove south on highway 580 toward San Jose to pick up my other son ((Name deleted)) 12 years old.
19810708	19971022	 Christiansburg, VA	 light	5-10 min	Summary : Observed light only, first slowly moving, appeared to be small private plane.Then stationary, moved in circle while changing colors ( can&apos;t recall all colors).Vacated the area at a speed too fast for jet.I was 14 years old at the time, and my father and I were out for a walk. Upon sighting the object, my dad asked &quot;Wonder what that guy is doing?&quot;, since at first it appeared to be just an ordinary light from a private plane. Then, as it began to circle and change colors, I asked ,&quot;How is he changing colors?&quot;. Dad said &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; and as the object left at great speed my dad said, &quot;I don&apos;t think we have anything that goes that fast.&quot;. I am now 30 years old, a former army officer (medical) and former army intelligence SGT. My dad is currently military intelligence, and has, shall we say, some difficulty publicly confirming my recollection of this event.This is of course very troubling to me since he does acknowledge it in private (with me), so to share the story without his verification (since I was a kid at the time), makes me look like a liar, or at best possessing a false recollection of an ordinary event.
19970705	19970707	 Caseyville, IL	 sphere	2 seconds	Summary : At first I thought it was a firework. But it was to high very high in the sky. I waited for another. Then I thought what was that?

19931125	19971110	 Mesquite (Approx. 15 miles west on I-15 of), NV	 other	5 min. approx.	Summary : Two adults driving see &quot;metallic&quot; objects in sky.  Look like commercial aircraft but no movement.  Watch objects for a couple of minutes slight movement.  Decide to stop and look thru binochulars but objects disappear as car stops.My brother and I where driving to Las Vegas, NV for a family get together.  It was late afternoon around 3:00pm.  We were driving west on I-15 approx. 15 miles west of Mesquite, NV when I noticed what I thought was a commercial airliner off to the South and approx. 50-60 degrees up.  The sky was clear not a cloud anywhere.  The object was &quot;metallic&quot; or &quot;white/silver&quot;.  Like a jet when the sun is gleaming off it.  I continued to glance up at the object and I relized it was not moving and had no contrail.  I said to my brother jokingly there is a UFO up there.  He pushed back the sunroof so he could look.  As I remember it took him a little while to pick the object out.  Then another object though not as bright appeared. At one time I could see 3-4 at one time.  They would fade out then come back either were the where or close.  We remembered we had binochulars so my brother got them out.  The car was vibrating too much to tell what they where.  We decided to stop.  As we did ! come to a stop the objects disappeared.  We waited awhile since they had been coming and going out of view.  But, they never came back.  We proceded on our way did not see them again.  We thought they may have been jet fighters at a very high altitude so as to appear as no movement.  Or possibly military aircraft dropping flares.  The first object was the brightest and lasted the longest.  It was moving VERY slowly to the south as it faded away.  Did anyone else see these objects or simular objects in this area?  Since it has been 4 years ago my memory of it is&apos;nt as sharp as it was.  One strange thing I did&apos;nt think of at the time was there was very little traffic on the highway.  Usually, as I have made this trip numorous times at Thanksgiving time the traffic is heavy.

19790701	19970622	 Maxwelton Beach (South Whidbey Isl.), WA	 circle	2-5 minutes	Hello.  I do not think that this &apos;sighting&apos;, if that is what it can be called, will be of any use to you because it happened so long ago.  But I came across your website and thought, what the heck, why not record it here anyway.  It happened when I was a child (I have estimated Summer of &apos;79) and sleeping out on the beach in front of our summer beach house with a friend of the same age.  (This was in an era when it was considered safe to let children do that).  I was woken up by something, probably in the early hours of the morning when it was still dark.  I got up and stood on the beach and saw a round object with multiple, multi-colored flashing lights either on the water or hovering just slightly above it.  The object was approximately 20-40 ft. from the shore, and there was a sound associated with it; like a white noise, but at a low, soft pitch.  At the time I thought the object was a submarine.  Now that I know what submarines look like, and that they cannot come that clo!se to shore, I know that it definitely was not.  Also at the time I was certain that it was not a boat - having grown up around boats and spending every summer on that beach, I was familiar with the shapes and appearances of boats.  Well....that is all I remember!  Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I am not making this up; the object that I saw could have been a perfectly legitimate &apos;vehicle&apos; of some kind, or I could have a faulty memory.  Anyway, good luck with your research.  FYI:  I am 27, female, married w/ one small child.  I work part-time for a Seattle non-profit.  I&apos;m not particularly into UFO&apos;s or other unexplained phenomena, in fact I could be called a skeptic.  But I am interested, and I am convinced that I saw this object back in the summer of &apos;79 when I was 9 years old.
19970509	19970513	 Phoenix, AZ	 light	3 minutes	Summary : 6-8 lights were seen flying in formation s.of phoenix. They would cluster, form V shapes, inverted Vs, cluster in a stationary loation. They then travelled west doing the same manuvers a high rate of speed. Clear skies, no moon, temp. approx 85, calm winds. Seen also by someone else located 3 miles west of me. None traditional aircraft could only manuver like these did.At approx. 21:50 on May 9, 1997, I was in my back yard located in south Phoenix. I observed 6-8 white round lights south of my location approx 3 miles at an altitude of approx. 10,000. The objects stayed in one place while they would cluster into such a tight formation that they appeared as one, then manuver into a V shape, inverted V shape, straight line and then back to a cluster. I went into my house and got my wife, 42 years old and two children 20 and 22 years to witness what I saw. We four watched the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes as they travelled west continuing to manuever into the aforementioned shapes until out of sight.I am a retired police officer, 47 years old. I have been trained to observe and report observations. This is the first such &quot;sighting&quot; myself and family have seen, however, I do believe in UPOs. I have trained as a pilot and have flown privately since 1968 and commercially since 1958. These objects were NOT conventional aircraft. I can be reached at my home at 602-((Number deleted)) in the evenings.

19970326	19970326	 Huron, OH	 circle	3 seconds	Summary : 2 UFO&apos;s sited at 10:30 PM Eastern time coming from Canada over Huron, Ohio moving at a very fast rate of speed, in unattached but similar patterns.I observed a dual UFO siting Wed night 3-26 at approximately 10:30 PMEastern time in Huron, Ohio.  2 objects appeared in the sky, coming fromthe NW (from huron) over Lake Erie.  They passed over Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio and took a 90 degree turn to the West, and vanished.  The objects were round, extremely illuminated, and although flying together,were not attached - they were &quot;zig zagging&quot; and not together, although generally in the same line of flight.  The objects were about 3 times the size of a star, not colored, and moving at an extremely high rate ofspeed.  They moved faster than any plane, or anything else I everobserved in the sky.  They were white in color, not blinking and slightly larger than an airplane would appear to be.Background of observer: 51 yr old American, married, professionaland business owner.  Observation was made while looking for aview of the comet.

It swooped with amazing speed towards the horizon.  When it reached its destination it proceedeed to hover for a period of one to two minutes.  I took cover behind a large bush along side the road. It had three lights on the craft that spun counter-clockwise and another beacon light that was on top of the craft that remained stationary. Then there was a tremendous flash and the object shot across the sky in a south-easternly direction and had disappeared within seconds. behind the Quien Sabe Mountains. was out of sight within seconds

19970421	19970421	 Stanwood, WA		3 sec.	Two young males witnessed a very bright light descend at approximately an 80 degree angle of depression from the horizontal in the western sky.  Estimated to be five times bigger that a typical bright star.The light descended to below the horizon to the west, formed by the tops of the Olympic Mountains. No sound was evident.
19970704	19970707	 Hazelwood, MO	 oval	3-5 sec	Summary : Green, half-capsule shaped object, streaking North-South across the sky. Disappeared half-way across.saw something unusual Friday night (7/4) with my boys (7 and 6).  Didn&apos;t think much about it at the time.  It got us talking about shooting stars and stuff.  Heard it on the radio today (KMOX) and thought I would pass this along. I&apos;ll start by saying I am not a UFO fanatic, I don&apos;t believe in aliens or beings from other planets.  But I certainly saw something unusual the other night. It was between 9:15-9:45, we were waiting for fireworks (the show started at 9:45). My 6 year old noticed it first, and caught my attention. It was green, bullet shaped (like half a capsule.  A rounded edge, flat back.  No stream or tail). Streaked across the sky, and vanished about half way across.  It moved quite quickly, maybe I saw it for 2-3 seconds before it was gone. At first I thought it was some unusualy fireworks (but thinking it is very large).  Then it disappeared as a firework would, but with no explosion or fanfare.  Just gone. It was quite large, perhaps as large in sight as a full moon. If I have my bearings correct, it streaked from North to South. I was at White Birch Park in Hazelwood, MO (St Louis county), facing McDonnell Blvd, it streaked from my left to right.

There&apos;s a strange smell too...  Like sulfur.  I don&apos;t know what it was, but it scared the crap out of me!It was a sphearical shaped ball of light.  It just zipped up about 50 ft. off the ground and shot away, up at an angle through an oak tree, burning a hole right through a giant limb; just like a hot knife through butter! I&apos;m just a normal person that went out side to look at the comet, hail-bop.

19970527	19970303	 ,	 rectangle		[Diary of my Encounters This is the story I have known since 1979. In 1979 I was holiday ing at a place called Berowra waters on the South coast near Sussex Inlet with five friends&apos; one of whose father owned the caravan park where we stayed.This caravan park is on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean and we would go to the beach everyday and spend most of the day their swimming, surfing and sunbaking.On this particular day I was standing on the shore with my friends father and mother who owned the caravan park when we looked towards the water facing south-east on a clear hot day( no clouds) and observed a black metallic mass that looked similar to an aircraft carrier on its side (approx length 1500ft long-200-400ft across) and slowly moving towards a cliff face which eventually hid most of the object but not before we discussed what it was and how something that big could stay airbo rne when it was apparently moving so slowly and not making a sound.The object was approx: less than three miles away travelling at two to five miles an hour and started to slowly move in a westerly direction over land, it seemed to take so long to move out of view that other people on the beach had by this time noticed what we were looking at and started to point in the air and their was approx ten to twenty people who saw the same thing up and down the beach.As owner of the caravan park numerous people asked them what it was and they responded that they didn&rsquo;t know, only that their was a Navy facility further down the coast, and Airforce Base at Nowra (ALBATROSS)The object (and it was a metal object)stayed in view for over half an hour from the time we first noticed it until it was lost behind the cliff face. We then proceed to climb the cliff to see if it could still be seen and their it was hovering for a considerable amount of time until a helicopter &amp; jet could be heard in the vicinity, and it slowly moved away, but not taking any notice of either helicopter or jet.In the meantime the southcoast radio station had been inundated with phone calls about strange bright white craft (and they did say craft, I was listening to the broadcast to see if anyone had reported what we had seen earlier) people described the objects, and up to ten were seen, as flying up and down the coast in pairs and one at a time, out to sea, and close to land, as being as bright as the sun, and reflecting the sun, and travelling very fast and occasionally turning back towards the way they had come. When I heard this I remember thinking that this was not what we had seen as the objects were to small, (the size of a houses I seem to remember) not the size of an aircraft carrier as we had seen a few hours earlier. The reports on the radio were the same day, only hours apart from our encounter.My impression was that this was a controlled event as this was winter holidays and the weather was so beautiful that thousands of people were at the beaches up and down the coast, the two people who were with me, and, owned the caravan park were well known in the area ,he was on the local council and had lived in the area all of there lives, and even had a street named after them, and were very honest and humble people who had never seen anything like it in their life, they were also aware of the military bases locally and had seen experimental aircraft before fly over the region, including Jets. I was seventeen at the time I am now thirty five and this was a very close sighting of a very immense object that moved extremely slow and showed no signs of external movement, but it had what appeared to be rivets or welding on the bottom on the side which faced us.At the time I really thought that this was not anything which had been manufactured in Australia and never once thought this was from outer space, now I&rsquo;m not so sure.Conclusion : Large black mass the size of an aircraft carrier: Moved slowly without sound: Stayed in view for a considerable amount of time: Was seen by numerous people: Weather was hot and cloudless: Other objects were also seen: Radio station reported strange craft seen up and down the coast: Object and smaller objects made of solid material: Reported to authorities: Was highly unusualThe Next time (also 1979)In the same year a few friends of mine decided to go to a lookout near Baulkham Hills  in the west of Sydney which was about to become a new suburb, the time was approximately 7.00 - 8.30 PM in summer, (daylight saving ) late November and was a clear night with no clouds, we had been their for a short time when I noticed three circular bright red lights moving south (coming from a northerly direction) in a controlled movement, they were approximately less than five miles away and at that distance appeared to be quite large, about the size of a average house and were moving in a orderly fashion and in no hurry, they were moving in a triangular motion, travelling about 3-10 miles an hour.They did no abrupt moves and stayed in the same formation for a long time (20-30min) before they seemed to reach a point near Prospect Reservoir, and one dived towards the ground at a tremendous speed, one left skyward at high speed, and the other one just seemed to dissolve into the night. We turned the radio on and 2WS, which is a local radio station reported that they had received phone calls from people asking what the lights could be.I asked one of my friends who was there, recently, did he remember that particular night and he described the exact things I have just explained, and he said that they seemed to be under some kind of control and maybe connected to each other as they did a peculiar pattern as they moved across the sky, but the same pattern right across the sky.Conclusion : Three Bright Red Lights with some kind of shape (circular): In a fixed formation (triangular): Seen by five people for a period of at least 20 min: Was reported on the radio by others, independent people: Disappeared  within seconds of each other: Cloudless viewing.Eleven Years Later (1990)I had just returned from Florida, in the States, earlier in the year and had recently lost my job and found myself with time on my hands so I decided to be involved in this new craze which was sweeping the globe 3D images.I managed to find a job in the city (Sydney, Australia) and was working selling 3D posters at Central Railway Station, literally. This was around Christmas 1990 and they were very popular, on this particular day which was a Monday I was just about to go to lunch when a rather tall gentleman of about 6ft 10in, tall, and with large features, long White hair and looking very much like an American Indian, remarked to me that his friend thought  that the brain was similar to a 3D image and the universal acceptance of these images had some kind of lost meaning which we were about to grasp again after a very long time.He then brought up the subject of his friend who had worked for NASA as a photographer and had a very high clearance in the military and had been asked to photograph the inside and outside of a Circular craft which had somehow come into the possession of NASA. He told me in no uncertain terms that his friend took photos of the objects door and as he moved inside and looked  back towards the outside that the door was now twenty to thirty feet higher and the inside was of immense size, yet from the outside the door and craft were rather small, he also me about the underground  nuclear test explosion which was apparently detonated to contain alien forces who had Killed up to 25 scientists and 44 military elite who had complained of human abductions, we had talked so long that I missed my lunch break, and I was working 12 hour days so what he had been telling me had taken nearly one hour, a friend of mine who had come into to see me stood their for the whole time and told me after!wards that what he had just said was really over the top but very interesting.The next day a Tuesday I was sitting in the top floor of a double decker train at 6.30 in the morning on my way to work, the train had just left Strathfield station when I noticed in the distance, a shape like a plane that seemed to be banking towards the train, I was looking for markings and wings as I thought it was a plane making a turn towards the airport when it suddenly approached parallel to the train and proceeded to pace the train.Most people who were on the train were asleep and I had an urge to wake them and say look out the window at this silvery disk shaped object which had by now slowed considerably and was now only one mile away and slowing down as we slowed down as we approached the next stop, the train had just slowed down for track maintenance when I noticed a tower between the object and the train, by the time we passed the tower which was about thirty feet across, the object had disappeared from view, as if someone had turned a switch and the object had just disappearedConclusion   : Strange encounter with person with Indian like appearance: Told me about something which I had heard years earlier underground: Observed a craft of no known origin the next day: Had seen it disappear before my eyes on a clear day: Was definitely metallic and polished silver - reflected the early morning sunlight: Had no markings whatsoever: No exhaust or smoke at all: Was seen for 10-15 minIn early (1993)Near the middle of April I was at a friends place in Blacktown ( 25 miles West of Sydney) we had just been outside and had seen a bright red object shining in a westerly direction at a very high altitude and not doing the normal flight you would expect from any aircraft, this lasted about five minutes before we lost it behind a tree, there were three of us, at about one hour after this I decided to go home, the time was about 10-11 PM.I lived about three miles away and on the way home had a Incredible encounter with multiple craft over Blacktown (where I live) it started when I reached the top of a hill on Locke St and was stopped at a set of traffic lights and noticed directly ahead less than a mile away a Huge Object, and smaller craft above the main one, the lights changed and I proceeded down the hill past the local hospital, and as I rounded the corner I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, their above the road less than five -hundred feet away I saw two objects- One, the bigger of the two had lights of different shades and colours which moved around the base and middle in a fast movement so that the lights seemed to catch up with each other and I could see what seemed to be railings inside the craft, the lights which were luminous colours-Green-washed in purples and yellows with a touch of Blue. There seemed to be a bright light coming from inside the large object.The object above the larger one had to be large also but wasn&rsquo;t doing anything other than sitting above the other one, I slowed down at another set of lights and saw a elderly gentleman who was walking along the footpath and I was going to wind down my window and ask him to look up at the Objects but thought  he might have a heart attack so I didn&rsquo;t say anything, while I was waiting for the lights to change they started to slowly move away over the hospital and I thought to myself that I was going to chase them ( the objects) at that very second as if they had heard what I had thought they accelerated to a brisk pace and I turned around and started to chase them, as I drove up the hill and turned east down Bungarribee Rd I stopped my car which overlooked a disused quarry and got out I notice two more objects hovering above my head at no more than 200ft above me, I then looked East and about half a mile away noticed another two cigar shaped objects the same as the ones above my!head, I then looked to the south and saw another object similar to the one above the large object that I was chasing and saw the two craft I was chasing moving at a slow speed in a south-easterly direction, in the direction of Bankstown Airport about fifteen miles away.While I was watching them both move away the two above me were still there not moving at all, I was out of the car and could almost touch them, they made no sound and seemed to just hover without any wobbling or movement, I continued to watch all seven objects for the next hour or so until the first two disappeared in the vicinity of Sydney and seemed to be moving in a large arc around the panoramic view I had (that is moving from south to east to nth east before I lost sight of them) I then noticed that the two smaller cigar shaped objects to the east had come down a bit lower and were near a radio tower 2WS and soon they too had mysteriously vanished, the objects above my head had begun to move away slowly and I saw that they were staying close together and moved slowly towards the horizon until they too had disappeared.I decided to go home and ring up the airport where I had seen the original two craft head towards, when I arrived home I had to move my mothers car under the carport, but, when I tried to start the car it wouldn&rsquo;t start, I finally gave up and got out of the car and looked up at the sky and the first craft I had seen with the revolving lights was directly above our house and was moving very slowly south back towards the location that I had first seen it, It was the same craft except I now had a better look at the whole Object, It was Large about 200ft in diameter and when I looked up was moving quite slowly almost as if it was waiting for something to catch it up. It then moved out of site and I went inside and rang up the airport who rang me three days later and asked me what I had seen and told me to ring the Airforce base at Richmond which I did and the person I talked to said that they had heard nothing about what I had just described.I left a message for my mother that her car wouldn&rsquo;t start and she rang the NRMA which is road service in New South Wales and when he turned up the car wouldn&rsquo;t start straight away and he said that it was a flat battery even though it was a new battery and the car had been driven less than four hours earlier that night.Conclusion   : Seven Objects seen in the space of a few hundred feet from each other: Coloured Lights seen emitting from around the Largest Object: Objects seen to Hover from a close distance: Seemed to hear what I was thinking: Some kind of railing seen inside large object: Bright White Light seen emitting from inside: Travelled right around the Metropolitan area: Somehow drained the power from the battery of car: Seen directly over my house so object had to of flown in a 360 deg arc around Sydney and surrounding areas: I had chased the first two objects which had been hovering over road near the HospitalBedroom Visitors 1994I had just arrived home from a friends place and was lying on the bed looking at the ceiling and looking out the window at the stars when I felt a sharp pain like a pin being stuck in my toes, the first thing I thought was that a white tailed spider had bitten me as there was an increase in these type of spiders around the house at the time.I felt like I was frozen and wanted to yell out but didn&rsquo;t want to disturb my mother who was asleep in the other room, I was wide awake and had only just put my head on the pillow seconds earlier thinking about tomorrow and things I had to do, when I felt the presence in my room and sounds from the foot of my bed, I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, and I still couldn&rsquo;t move at all and it was then that I felt hands around my feet where the pin prick had been and I could only lift my head slightly and I saw five small figures looking at me at the foot of the bed (they had came out of my wardrobe) and I could see that the wall where the wardrobe was now different and looked like the inside of a giant hanger which went back into the wall a considerable distance.There were two small entities standing at the end of my bed and one had stuck me with a needle in the toe and one was holding my ankle and examining my ankle area, while this was happening I thought that I hope my mother in the next room doesn&rsquo;t wake up and disturbs these entities as they might panic and hurt her, or she might panic and something bad might happen to her, then what seemed like a few seconds I noticed three more figures coming out of the wardrobe and stand at the foot of the bed and proceeded to stick something in my leg, I started to feel able to move again, only slightly and lifted my head off the pillow and saw right into their faces and they looked back with curious looks on their faces but never stopped doing whatever they were doing but they knew I was looking straight at them and I was wide awake.They were not trying to intentionally hurt me and I felt no fear and I could remember everything that they were doing and I was aware of  being awake and this was not a dream, I tried to communicate with them, I couldn&rsquo;t talk, as no sounds came from my mouth, but I could hear my voice from deep down from within.They were quite solid, long arms but not abnormal, smallish heads not extremely large, more like small children feeling around, playing, around 3-4ft tall, dark greyish in appearance with lizard like scales, and the skin seemed the same colour throughout the body as far as I could see, and I could see just below their knees, they had a almost sad look about them and there was definitely some kind of rank as one or two ordered the others around, not with words or telepathy but they just seemed to obey without answering, and these other two stayed in the background moving around the room and observing, occasionally looking over to see what was happening.They still had hold of my ankle and reminded me of well trained doctors with nurses helping them, this was a real event, on one occasion one stepped back into the wardrobe to retrieve something and came back with it in its hand and I noticed that it had three large type fingers that seemed to be too large to do anything intricate yet here they were doing things to me with the skill of a surgeon, I felt no pain except for the initial discomfort of a pinprick in my toe, I heard no voices only muffled sounds and yet I could tell that this wasn&rsquo;t going to be a adverse experience.They wanted to look at my legs and feet and didn&rsquo;t come near my face or touch any part of me except my toes and ankles, although they had direct contact with my eyes. They seemed to me to be quite aware of my feelings and as they continued  they would look my way to see if I was in any discomfort and all looked when I thought of my mother, before they left I noticed they looked back at me as they went back into the wardrobe, one at a time, in a very orderly fashion, and the last thing before they vanished the wall came back to its original distance and the hanger like area which reminded me of inside a large ship gradually disappeared in a cloud like vapour.It was then that I felt the sensation of my foot and toe and I immediately jumped up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and could see that I was wide awake and when I checked the time it was less than three minutes since I had arrived home, which was impossible as I had made something to eat when I first arrived home.It was then when I heard my mother talk that I realised it was all over and I have since sold the wardrobe and painted the room and had a inbuilt wardrobe installed.Later in the week I went to a friend who has a paranormal interest and he took out of my toe a small black object that wasas hard as a needle and was giving me quite a bit of pain.Conclusion : Five Entities in my bedroom: A small metal as hard as a needle was found in my toe: I was wide awake the whole time: There was eye contact and concern on their part: I saw a kind of entrance to another dimension: Some type of medical procedure had happened: Two entities in charge of procedures: Grey in appearance with skin that was like a mold: They knew what to do and had me paralysed from the neck down.: They also had a sad look- the kind of look when you say goodbye to someone you have feelings forEarly (1996)I had just came home and was going inside to  get my telescope to look at Jupiter and the Moon when I looked west and saw a fast moving object which I thought was a white aeroplane that looked like a wireframe, until I saw a smaller object either come out of the original object or came up alongside and seemed to refuel while all the time the other object was moving at a incredible speed. They stayed together for approximately 15 seconds which was a long time considering it travelled across the horizon and out of sight in that time.I rang Bankstown Airport and they told me to ring Richmond Airforce Base which I immediately did and was put through to the officer in charge of aircraft dispatches who told me that no planes would refuel over residential areas Ever and especially not at night. I know what I saw and that was a low, very high speed object with a smaller object that was seen to pace and be refuelled in mid air at about 11PM at night earlier this year 1996.Conclusion : High speed Object wireframe in appearance: Smaller Object seen to pace and be refuelled by larger object: In view for a short amount of time: Incredible speeds for both craft: Large Craft was white in appearance: Smaller Craft seemed to be see through.JUNE LONG WEEKEND (9/6/96)Sun: Time: 9.25-9.55This happened on Sun long weekend of June this year I had just dropped Lloyd who is a friend of mine at his place and he was taking his things inside when I noticed three orange/red/yellow lights pulsating and slowly moving high in the sky above Blacktown. They were in a large Triangular shape from three to five files apart, the top light of the triangle stayed in a constant spot as did the bottom left light, the light on the bottom right though moved away and pulsated in and out and disappeared on occasions and then reappeared slowly moving away from the other two until it completely disappeared from view. The other two started to slowly move away with the bottom left light going higher and the top light moving across and over the bottom light, moving east and moving very slowly, the other light moved away at the same speed going north-east and very slowly. We decided to ring a few friends who have cameras and videos and after a good half hour with the objects still in sight !I decided to go home as it was getting quite cold. We were looking through high powered binoculars and their appeared to be a solid object behind the light. As I drove home which is about two miles away I could see the remaining lights from the car quite clearly and thought that when I arrive home I would have a look through the telescope. When I arrived at my house both objects could still be seen very easily by the naked eye and through the telescope I could see that their was a light in the centre of the mass which was causing the brightness, I watched both for a considerable time until the light that was moving slowly to the north-east had stopped and had taken on the appearance of a star and was now acting as though it was stationary so I turned my attention to the other light which was now over the Windsor area travelling north-west but was still in sight for a considerable time before it was just a blur and by which time it was  icy cold, I turned the telescope again to!wards the first light and it was just sitting there stationary as a star would look, I then went to bed and when I went to work the next day I asked Lloyd if they took any pictures and he proceeded to tell me what happened later that night in front of at least seven people.After I left his friends turned up but the objects had been gone for a while before they turned up, so they went to another friends place just around the corner and this is three different accounts of what happened next starting with:
19970728	19971015	 Washington, D.C., DC	 other	.23 secs	Summary : While on vacation in Washington, DC, standing in front of the White House, my 8 yr old son captured something very strange on our video camera. The object appears in 7 frames of a standard 30 frame per second VHS tape. I am not experienced in these matters. I have had the tape digitally analyzed and the object appears to have a definite form and reflects sun light as if it were metallic. It was pure accident that we caught it on video and did not discover it until we were back home viewing the vacation tape.This is an interseting video. I would appreciate some assistance in presnting this to media. please call.
19970725	19970726	 Phoenix, AZ			Summary : saw news clip of what the USAF said were flares form a jet on a 5 pm newscast here in Bos. MA on 7/25.  My wife said there was clearly a round shape to what she thought the lights were afixed to within the amature video.  Did you see the broadcast?  It surely did not look like flares.  Just thought you may want to try to take a look at the film.  It was on our channel 5 here in Bos., MA. Thanks, ((name delete))   ((e-address deleted))
19740615	19970522	 San Diego (Mission Bay Walk/Santa Clara Ct. M.B.), CA	 sphere	3+min	Summary : Enormous object to star like size in a flashI was carrying my 3mo old daughter accompaniedby my wife and 5 or more strangers were nearbyDusk waschanging to dark, the area was well lit, welloccupied by people, and somewhat busy asMission Beach is at that time of year.What appeared to be an object on fire overheadsoon became an large,dark,round object thatseemed to loom above us in silence with whatappeared to be lights around its exterior.the object was either the size of a city blockand close to the ground 500-1000ft or it wasincredibly huge and much higher in elevation.I started to walk away because of fear formy infantdaughter but stopped to look back, when I didit instantly disapeared until my wife pointedit out to all of us as a tiny star like objectmoving quickly south (faster that a fighter jet)It then stopped abruptly and a object bestdescribed as; lite, no lite, lite, no liteflashed across the sky westerly in a straight- - - - - -line, then it resumed its fast flightdue south and faded out of sight.That evening there were reports of strangelites off shore facing west.The strangest co-incidence to this story isthat the San Diego Union reported the nextmorning that a main electrical sub-station ineither the Phillipines or the Marshall&apos;s hadbeen scorched and burnt and shut down - causeunknown, that previous evening.Further, a similiar sighting just two+ weekslater in a major Florida city came up with asimiliar result i.e; a scorched &amp; burntsub-station.I&apos;ve got an extensive radar and aircraftand missile background and not easilyled or fooled. This was strange and we&apos;vekept it to ourselves until now.Thanks to you and Art Bell, I&apos;m talking.
19970704	19970707	 Millstadt, IL	 light	3 SEC	Summary : blue light traveling due west ended in red flash appeared to be close overhead. I think it was space junk or meteor due to similar sightings over a broad area.Due to the fact that the object was on a precise east to west trajectory, in line with the earth&apos;s rotation, I would guess that it was probably space junk burning up in the atmosphere.
19970322	19970323	 Unadilla, NY	 light	2 sec	Summary : I have video of strange light in SE sky over central NY 21:30 est 03/22/97
19971129	19971202	 Gorman (60 miles north of Los Angeles), CA	 light	10-min.	Summary : I was coyote calling on top of a mountain at night, and the sky was dark with clouds. A red flickering light came down through the cloud cover, at first I thought it was a red beacon for a tower that was on the hill but then realize they were behind me and this was out over the Interstate 5 freeway. It moved around in a lazy manor the faded away... gone. Others on the freeway must have seen it also, there was alot of traffic at that time.The object was a red light that was flickering vary fast, it was on the bright side but not like a fire, but a light. It was not going on a set course, but wandering about the sky. The cloud cover was not to high, may be 1000 feet over my location on the hill. I heard no sound and after it faded away, I packed up and drove with my lights off until I reached the old ridge rout road. I was shacken alittle. May have been a military craft? I don&apos;t know.
19971114	19971117	 Portland, OR	 formation	5 hours	Summary : Two bright lights appeared over the neighbors house and seem to go back and forth, stand still and pulsated at the same time.  They looked like fireworks in the sky.My name is ((Name deleted)) and I saw a light rising from somewhere behind my neighbors house in the sky.  It did not act like an airplane but before I called my children to come and witness it I stepped out the door and watched it rise rapidly straight up into the air.  I called my four children out to watch with me. At first we only saw one and then another one appeared over another neighbors house--what really amazed us was how they seemed to be pulsating in a pattern together.  They actually looked like fireworks in the sky when they were doing this.  Everyone I saw who was walking down the street I pointed it out to them--(they thought we were nuts).  I was talking to my Office Manager at work about it off and on while she was at work.  We tried to call the news stations but nobody would listen we didn&apos;t have a video camera so we couldn&apos;t take pictures.  One of the objects stayed pretty low and started heading off behind some trees, we decided to follow after a minute to see if w! e could still see it.  It was in a holding pattern over a main street, it stayed there for at least 20 minutes then  it took off it made other planes in the sky look as if they were standing still. One of my children wrote about it in her journal right away but I held off until Sunday.  It was a wonderful and exciting sight.  I was really upset that nobody would listen to us in the news media and when the news came on later we heard it was &quot;space junk&quot;, Who are they trying to kid?
19970225	19970304	 Crystal Lake, IL	 sphere	3-4 seconds	Summary : I was laying on the sofa looking out the window at 2:00am with the Moon and Mars in the sky and all of the sudden I saw an orange-red ball whiz between the Moon and Mars. I am an amatuer astronomer and know for certain it was not a meteor or satelite and it was moving too fast to be a plane or other form of aircraft which I am familiar with.It darted across the entire sky from my viewpoint.  I am not saying it was a ufo but I cannot identify what it was.  I have been looking at the sky all my life and have never seen anything that looked like that.It was orange-red and round.  I cannot judge how far it was awaybut it was really fast. Whenever I get the chance to view the stars I am and have never seen anything like it with my naked-eye or through my telescopes.I have always believed in life other than on our own planet because we are just a grain of sand in the desert compared to the universe, so it would be concieted to say we are the only life in the universe.This is my first real sighting of something I can&apos;t explain.
19970310	19970510	 Virginia Beach, VA	 sphere	8-10sec.	Summary : White, spherical object moving in a NW trajectory, silent, moving extremely fast.On March 10, 1997,went outside after lunch for a brief walk.Cloudless, clear day.  Looked up and noticed a single, very white, round objectmoving from east to northwest (this is a coastal area of VA).  At first thought itwas baloon, but quickly realized moving much too fast and straight.  No vapor,exhaustor noise whatsoever.  When first observed, appeared to be about the size of a shirtbutton held at arm&apos;s length.  Disappeared within 8-10 seconds.This area is close to Naval air stations; very familiar with various conventionalcraft.  Nothing like this seen before.  Was very round and bright white.I am a 46 year-old health care executive.  Am MUFON member (recently joined); have beeninterested in the phenomenon for decades, and well read on subject, but maintain a sceptical yet open mind.Inclined to favor a more scientific, empirical approach.This was definitely NO conventional craft!
19970302	19970305	 Prairie du Sac/Merrimac ( between. on Hwy. 78), WI	 cross	5 to 10 min.	Summary : One small object with rotating lights, then a little later a large brilliantly lit object in the shape of a cross with 4 bright lights accrossthe back and 3 up the center. Small rotating object seemed to join large object which decended blow treetops, resembled a formation. a week prior during daylight another object witnessed by 2 people in two different places seen suspended in north sky, very bright, and quiet and floating, not like a plane.The small object with the rotating lights seemed to linger in a general area of the sky and spin around, soon after we saw it, a large object came from the northwest and the small object seemed to disappear, whether it joined the large objectwe don&apos;t know for sure. the large object was very brilliant in the shape of a cross with 4 bright lights accross the back and 3 bright lights up the center (a bottom view), we were traveling north and the large object rapidly disappeared below the treetops to ourSoutheast. The week before I and my daughter who was going home from work 10 miles away, saw a shiny cigar or flattened oval shape, very brilliant in the north sky in broad daylight. I watched it and so did she, it didn&apos;t seem to be going anywhere and didn&apos;t make any noise.It just sort of drifted in the sky,and appeared quite large.My daughter was in Baraboo heading northeast and I was standing outside my home just looking at it for at least 3 to 5 minutes.
19970527	19970317	 Huntington, UT	 light	about 6sec.	Summary : I&apos;m 15 years old and this happened about a year ago but I just found this place to submit it.

19970307	19970308	 Seattle, WA	 flash	1 sec	Summary : Less than a 1 second flash of large blue-white light, climbing slightly on it&apos;s path from west to east. .I was traveling N. on Beall Rd. on Vashon Island when I saw a large blue-white light, larger than jet lights (common here), move from low left to 30 degrees higher toward the right (East). Very fast. Thought, &quot;Is this that comet?&quot; But I don&apos;t think the comet is that huge or fast. Doubt that this was a shooting star.  Trees obscured the progression path from my vision.
19971114	19971119	 Alaska Airlines/Sea-Tac to Anchorage (Canada), BC	 formation	unknow	Summary : Stewardess informs passengers that a satellite has broken up and is coming over the airplane.Stewardess explains to passengers on flight that a Russian satellite has broken up and pieces flew over the plane resulting bright light.((NUFORC Note:  Many reports from Oregon, Washington, and Canada for this event.  Similar events, we believe, over California and Mexico at same time and date.  PD))
19960501	19971203	 Burns (100 miles south of, no city), OR	 triangle	15 minutes	Summary : Bright lights at night in the desert that hovered over the road, then sped away.We were visiting at a ranch in Catlow Valley, OR approx. 45 north of the Nevada border.  I woke up and found that my fiance was sitting at the table in our travel trailer. I called out to him and he told me to come here, quickly. When I got to where he was, I saw bright lights out by the road, coming towards the meadow.  They were approx. 1/4 mile away.  We watched as they hovered about 20&apos; above the road and moved back and forth across the road.  This is desert area and the nearest house is about 4 miles to the north. This object was coming from the north east direction, moving somewhat south west.  When it reached the bottom of the meadow, it turned, raised in the air slightly and headed due west straight across the desert.  It was very bright and moving quickly.  In a matter of minutes, it covered at least 10 miles and then just disappeared.  The object appeared to be very large in size -- maybe 30&apos; tall or more and about 20&apos; across.  It was almost triangle shaped, with lights along the bottom, on the sides and on the top.  Where the object was spotted, there is nothing but sagebrush and there is no chance that it was any type of vehicle known to us.  There is no road out that way, no people, no houses, etc.  After the object was gone, my finace confessed to me that he saw something similar to that the previous year when he was at this same ranch helping with the haying, but he didn&apos;t tell me because he was the only one to see it and didn&apos;t think I would believe him. straight across the desert.  I watched until it was about a mile out in the desert and I could still see it clearly, then, all of a sudden, it tilted upward slightly and was gone.
19810601	19971122	 The Dalles, OR	 fireball		Summary : Ball of fire moving up the Columbia River. Just made a &quot;B&quot; line. No sudden movementWas just turning dusk. Summer of 1981. I looked up in the sky and saw a ball of fire moving up the Columbia River Gorge. I ran in the house to tell others, they too came out to see fire ball. My friend was also with me. I called the radio station and they said that it was a weather ballon. (Yah right!) We didn&apos;t have a camera which I wished I did have one. All I have is memories of the fire ball that movied horizonally up the River and out of sight, never burning out. It made NO noise what so ever.
19940608	19970624	 Idaho Falls, ID	 changing	10 min.	Summary : Strange, form-changing objects seen over Idaho Falls.It was ((3 name deleted)), and I.  All except ((Name deleted)) were about 13.  ((Name deleted)) was 15.  We are sisters and ((Name deleted))  was our friend.  The 4 of us were lying on the trampoline.  Suddenly ((Name deleted)) sees something.  It appeared from behind the large pine tree.  We were looking East, it moved from North to South.  It was sort of shaped like a slanted T.  It had little orange cicles along it.  It was very dark.  It was an outline, really, with circles on it.  It changed shape, which frightened us.  It glided very smoothly.  It was too low to be any kind of aircraft, too quite too.  It made a slight pulsing humming sound.  It eventually disappeared out of view.  We stayed outside.  A few minutes later another one flew by.  It was sort of H-shaped.  The circles blinked lighter and darker, and some blinked on and off.  It came from the same place and moved the same.  It gave a high-pitched beeping sound.  It followed the other&apos;s path and was out of view in a few minutes.  We were spooked enough, s!o we went inside.

19970507	19970522	 Santa Monica, CA	 disk	2 minutes	Summary : On May 7, 1997 I was looking north to the Santa Monica mountains and saw what I believed to be a helicopter shining its lights down on the ocean or the mountains. I live in a penthouse where I have a wonderful view of the Santa Monica Mountains, the ocean and the city.  On a clear night, as this was, I can see very far.  I often sit out side to relax and look at my surroundings.  It is not uncommon to regularly see helicopters and planes from my view, especially with LAX so near.  This particular evening I saw what I thought to be a helicopter and it  really caught my attention.  I noticed that this helicopter was silent and usually they make quite a bit of noise.  I was looking at the object that I believed to be a helicopter and there was a direct light that it was shining  on the mountains, like a spotlight,  and moving low towards the ocean.  It was in a two to three mile distance of me, which is common for most of the helicopters in the area.  The light that I was watch!ing closely, without suspicion, disappeared, leaving puffs of smoke.  This was a trail of smoke that I had never seen a plane or a helicopter leave before.  The smoke was thick as if the object that it was coming from had been idled there for a long peroid of time and it had not been.  A few seconds later the object took off with enormous speed, heading north to the sky.  this is when I realized that the object could not be a helicopter at all.  Within seconds it was &quot;parked&quot; next to a star, very far away..  It probably reached its location next to the star in under five seconds. It was a clear path that it took and  it was as if it was trying to camaflauge itself  next to that star.  Then I saw a flashing red light that was actually  revolving.  From the distance where I was I could see the object and  I could tell that it was revolving with a red light..  A few seconds later it took off so fast that I could see it going north for about two seconds but it was going so fast th!at it just disappeared.  That is when I realized that I had seen a UFO.  I immediately called a friend and left a detailed message on her voice mail, as to not leave out any details and record it while it was fresh in my mind.  The next day I had to go out of town and did not know of your service until now.  I feel very relieved to have reported this and hope that someone may have seen something also.I have lived in California for a little over a year.  I moved to California from South Carolina for a job.  I am twenty four years old and am fairly concervative in my beliefs.  I was raised an &quot;Army Brat&quot;, therefore traveling is nothing new to me.   I run four miles every morning before work and consider myself to be very social.  I have never looked up the UFO website before.See above listed information.

I thought that i was observing this as a bright light low on the southwestern horizion, and made a comment about it to the driver of the vehicle i was in. i reached in to the back seat to retrive my 8mm video camera when i turnd around the sight was gone, this seemd strange since star light fades out, any way i kept looking in the same area when i saw movement next to the mountain on my left.  I could see somthing in the air above the side of the mountain only because the trees were reflected off the bottom of the craft.  as i begain to video tape and try to get it in focus which was difficult because the camera was new to me and i had it on auto focus, and had to take it off auto focus.while all this was going on it flew over us at what i estamete was a 1000ft then it stopped above and to the right rear of my field of vision and it flew back into the light of the morning sun and was once again lighted ! brightly, and i was able to focus and begin recording.you can see the saucer shape and see it travel very quickly away and over a hill.

19970316	19971005	 Maricopa (southwest of town), AZ	 light	4-5 min.	Summary : 8-10 bright stationary orange lights, plus a small line of 6-8 smaller  bluish-white lights which flashed in succession from l. to r., moved off rapidly to the west, disappeared, reappeared, and repeated event 3 times.While traveling south on Maricopa road 2 women, one a Sales Manager and the other a Director of Sales for a large telecommunications firm witnessed a group of 8-10 bright orange stationary lights in the sky just above a line of mountains to the SW of the town of Maricopa, AZ.  In the midst of these lights a small line of 6-8 bluish-white smaller lights suddenly appeared; the lights flashed in sequence from left to right 3 times, then suddenly moved very quickly off to the West and disappeared.  Approximately 30-45 seconds later, the bluish-white lights reappeared in approximately the same position as the first time and repeated the flashing and movement; then reappeared just to the west of te original location repeated this once more.  About 30 seconds after the last repeat, the orange lights simply disappeared.  The orange lights appeared very similar to the sightings on Sept. 13 in the area around Phoenix, but we have heard no one mention the bluish-white lights which we s! aw.
19970510	19970517	 Sedona, AZ	 light	5-10 mins	Summary : A very bright palsing light with smaller bright object flying around larger object.We had just finished dinner in a outdoorsecond floor restaurant in Sedona AZ at 9:55 PMwhen one of our party pointed out a light that was20 to 30 degrees above the eastern desert ofSedona. The light moved slightly but pulsed inintensity from star brightness to very bright.A second smaller bright object seemed to flyoff and fly around the larger object with quickmoves above, below and around the large object.At times the small object would drop below thelarger in a falling leaf motion and fly backto the larger object becoming one object agian.We watched from the restaurant for 5 mins andgot into our car and drove to a better locationto watch the object. We parked on the cliff aboveour hotel. We watch this object carry on again foranother five mins before it just blinked out.The object seemed to be several miles away fromour location. No noise and clear skies in the Eastwith the moon to our backs. Several airliners couldbe seen flying to the SE in the Phoenix directionTwo of the observers are photographers and theother two observers are visitors from New Zealand
19970313	19970328	 Newfoundland, NJ	 oval	5 min	Summary : Driving N/W on Rt. 23 on the way home from 3rd shift. After passing thru a trarric lite i noticed a glimmer off to the left hand side. I looked over thinking it was a jet or plane of some kind. The sky was clear with unlimited visibility. It didn&apos;t look like anything I had seen before. I pulled over to the shoulder of the road and watched it for a couple more minuts. It seemed to move slowly in a nothern direction and the suddenly vanished. I can&apos;t say what way it went. It just vanished.The sky that morning was 100% clear. At that time of day ther is not much traffic on the road. This part of northern N.J. is covered with more trees and less popopulated the areas closer to N.Y. It was a long silvery shape that didn,t seem to be moving at first. After I stoped i could see that it was moving very slow. And then it just vanised in the blink of an eye. It was easy to see thet it had no wings or a tial section like a plane would. I live next to a small airport and have a fair idea of planes. Both my Inlaws flew most of their lives and being around planes is common. This was not a plane. I don&apos;t know what it was.
19970510	19970618	 Southside (Gadsden), AL	 other	@2-3 minutes	Summary : Two bright objects hovering one moment then taking off at high speeds, beyond aircraft speeds.  These two objects seemed to stop and go, zipping around as if they were playing.Mothers Day weekend I visited my mother who lives in Alabama. That Saturday evening I was going outside to see if there were any remains of the Halle Bopp comet.While star gazing, I saw two objects.  They were round in shape and bright white with blue haze encircling them in color.  At first I only saw one, it was darting forward in an unimaginable rate of speed.After watching about 30 seconds the second object zoomed up behind the first and they were going the same speed for about 10 seconds.  Then the second object stopped still, while the first jetted around at different angles in front and behind the second.I then saw both objects start and stop several times.  Then the first one stopped then went straight up in an instant.  The second object then went forward until it disappeared.Im not sure what these two objects were, but I do know that there are no aircraft or weather ballons that I know of that could have moved at those angles and speeds.I dont want to sound like a kook, but I am curious if anyone else had witnessed this event.  Afterwards, I went in to tell my husband and mother what I had seen and they believed me, but were skeptic and offered several explainations that I found hard to believe.

19970313	19970320	 Mesa (at Mesa Community College), AZ	 triangle	2-3 MINUTES	Summary : LARGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT WITH 5 DIM AMBER LIGHTS (ONE IN EACH CORNER AND 2 MORE NEAR FRONT) MOVED SLOWLY NW TO S-SW WITH NO NOISE.I SAW THE OBJECT AT MESA COMMUNITY COLLEGE, WHERE I AM A STUDENT. THE TIME WAS APPROX. 8:30-8:50 PM (I DIDN&apos;T CHECK THE TIME UNTIL LATER, SO THIS IS AN ESTIMATE) AND I WAS WALKING WEST. I WAS LOOKING AT THE CONSTELLATION ORION (SW) WHEN I NOTICED A CONSTELLATION LIKE TRIANGULAR CLUSTER OF 5 DIM AMBER LIGHTS (NW) OPPOSITE ORION. I  BEGAN TO OBSERVE THIS CLUSTER OF LIGHTS AND QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THEY WERE SLOWLY MOVING (NW TO S-SW) AND THAT THEY WERE PART OF A TRIANGULAR SHAPED OBJECT. THERE WAS A LIGHT IN EACH CORNER AND 2 MORE NEAR THE FRONT, WHICH FORMED A SMALLER TRIANGLE..  *.      .*          .*              .*   .      ..  .*I HEARD NO NOISE. I ASKED ANOTHER PERSON WHO WAS READING THE SCHOOL PAPER IF HE SAW IT, AND HE SAID HE DID AND NOTED THAT THEY WERE MOVING. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN ANY AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ONE. ALSO, I NOTED THAT THER WERE AT LEAST 3 AIRCRAFT IN THE SKY AT THE TIME (2 NORTH AND 1 SOUTH), ALTHOUGH NOT CLOSE TO THE OBJECT. I OBSERVED IT FOR AT LEAST 2-3 MINUTES UNTIL IT WAS NO LONGER VISIBLE IN THE S-SW (IT APPEARED THAT THE LIGHTS DIMMED BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN OBSCURED BY CLOUDS?). IT MOVED IN A SLIGHTLY CURVED, ALMOST STRAIGHT PATH.
0000	19970721	 Shepherdstown, WV	 light	2minutes	Summary : saw a bright white flashing (2 to 3 sec intervals) light in a field approx. 40 ft in the air. object was stationary.coming home from a fishing excursion on the potomac river, a thunderstorm was rolling in. i noticed an unusally bright flash ahead of me to the right of the road.the light appeared to be much brighter and &quot;whiter&quot; than the lightening in the sky at the time.the light was stationary and flashing at regular intervals of approx. 2-3 seconds. the light was flashing towards my car not in all directions. i could not see the object producing the light but there is no known source to my knowledge that would produce this light in this field.i feel certain that this was not a known aircraft common to this area.
19970601	19970601	 Greenfield (suburb of Milwaukee), WI		2min	Summary : Noticed a very large, slow moving, reddist tinted object in the northern sky. It appeared to have 2 smaller objects flying around it. Fom my point it appeared that the object was about 150 ft up and approximately 1/2 to 1 mile long. No noticeabe lights.At about 2 pm, I noticed a _very_ large object north of my apartment. It appeared to have a reddish hue, and was moving fairly slow, but steadily towards the east.I then noticed two smaller objects circling around it and managed to see one of the objects through my 4.5&quot; telescope. Although I couldn&apos;t keep it in the field of view long, it appeared to be somewhat like an airplane, but more like &quot;ship&quot; shaped.&gt;From the fact that these two objects were flying around the main object, and I live close to an airport and see air traffic all the time, the main craft must have been anywhere from 1/2 to 1 mile long. I could only see the edge and it was fairly thin, probably 40-50 feet.Anyway, it was huge. I would like to know if anyone else in the area reported anything. The thought occured to me that it could have been one of those advertising banners, but I did not see anything pulling it and on second thought it was far too big to be a banner.((Name deleted)) am a computer artist, amatuer astronomer, business owner and sky watcher.

19971222	19971226	 Costa Rica,	 disk		Summary : 12/26/97.. A mass sighting of UFOs over Costa Rica, C.A. was reported on CNNs web site this morning.. you might want to check it out.I&apos;m sending the article: Unidentified Flying Objects Spotted Over Costa Rica. Itar-Tass 26-DEC-97 MEXICO CITY, December 26 (Itar-Tass) - The Costa Rican mass media reported on Thursday that unidentified flying objects were spotted the day before in the country&apos;s air space over Golfito district, which is 330 kilometres to the south of San Jose. However, TV cameramen were unable to film them as they did on Monday. On December 22 cameramen from two local television channels filmed at least a dozen &quot;flying saucers&quot; in the sky south of the Costa Rican capital. Before the eyes of hundreds of people, they made zigzag maneuvers for several minutes. Flight controllers of the International Juan Santamaria Airport counted &quot;approximately fifty thousand traces&quot; of their movements. Some car drivers stopped to watch the phenomenon. According to Ufologist Carlos Vilchez, most remarkable is the fact that these UFOs appeared in daytime, that they were seen by hundreds of people and were filmed by TV cameramen. He also expressed the view that an influx of UFOs into the air space of this Central American country could be expected within the next two months. About ten &quot;saucers&quot; were watched by hundreds of people over San Jose exactly one month ago. They flew over the city for several minutes. They were also filmed by TV cameramen. Scientists have not found any explanations for this phenomenon.
19970513	19970514	 Cottonwood, AZ	 light	45min	Summary : My wife alerted me to a strange light in the sky. &quot;A ufo&quot; I was indoors - I replied &quot; Oh yea...hmm&quot;She insisted I com and take a look.Looking north, north west slightly, a very bright objectmoved in a somewhat eratic manner. Occasionally moving from left to right very quickly.My wife said that it one point had a bright &quot;tail&quot;extending from it.I did not see this feature. It did shange in color from white to orange.At one point it suddenly dropped out of sightstraight down.I went to the front yard to have another look.at this point I saw the object much higher in the sky. Slowly moving north and slightly west.I drove to a location with less light obstruction - within 5 min it had moved rather far away. Traveling north and slightly west. My guess in the direction of Ashfork or even Kingman. There was a 2nd object traveling in the same direction as well.When we first spotted it it seemed to nr VERY close to us.The eratic motion, change in intensity, ruled out an aircraft.Last spotted around 23:15 hours headed north north west as I said.Shape: oval in nature.Color: white changing to orange then staying orange.As it traveled toward the north looked like smaller sattelite objects assosiated with it at times. Was hard to tell.SeeSee above.

19971230	19971230	 Victorville (east of), CA	 circle	4-5 seconds	Summary : glowing circular object about 30 degrees above the  southwestern horizon.  Was moving slowly down and had no trail like a meteorite. Object was about three times as bright as large as the planet Venus.
19970817	19970818	 Philadelphia, PA	 sphere	7 hours	Summary : I sighted in daylight between 1 and 8 small, bright, round objects high in the sky over a period of 7 hours that flew from north to east in usually in three&apos;s in various patterns(triangular, stacked, linear).I first spotted these bright, white round or oblong objects (they resembled a bright star)at 9:30 am on Sunday August, 17, 1997  in the morning. I noticed one such oject  flying from west to east  above and behind a blimp which was traveling slowly in the opposite direction. I viewed this through a a glass door overlooking downtown Philadelphia, PA from my fifth floor apartment building. The sky was clear blue. I opened the door onto an outside porch to view the flying bright object unobstructed. There were two other objects on the right flying east. They were not flying terribly fast, but they appeared to be flying in a triangular formation. I sighted such objects from 9:30 am until 4 pm. They would continue for the most part to appear from the north and fly east. There would be anywhere from one object to eight objects in the sky at once, moving in and out of various flight patterns (triangular, stacked, linear). They usually flew in three&apos;s in a triangular formation. Somethimes two would fly very close together, and then move apart. Sometimes two would fly as a double on top of one another or next to one another. At 1:30 pm I saw as many an eight objects in the sky at once. I was walking to the market a few blocks from my apartment building. When I reached the store I could see above the store  moving from north to east approx. seven or eight bright round objects. They resembled a bright star, like venus. There was, however, at this time one object that appreared brighter than the rest and its upper portion flashed or blinked. Next to it appeared an object that was smaller and appeared a dull red. That object moved east and disappeared. Three of the other objects moved north and four others moved east. By the time I returned home, I could see two objects stacked on top of one another flying east. These objects were small. It is hard to guess at what altitude they were flying. I would say at least 30,000 feet. Objects would appear out of the north and fly east until about 4:00 pm. At least one or two was always present in the sky. Then they tapered off and by 4-4:30 pm, there were no objects sighted.  My roommate saw the objects as well and was baffled. It was very strange since it lasted such a long period of time. I called one of the local news stations around 2 pm, but nothing was reported on the evening news. The objects were not very large, the size of a star, like venus. They were very bright, white in color. They moved with a strange fluidity. That is what caught my attention initially. They would move together and apart quite rapidly and in and out of various formations.There is an airport that is nearby and many planes could be seen while the objects were visible. But the objects and a plane cou! ld not be confused because of the objects movement. They moved with an agility that I have never seen a plan demonstrate. I am a native of the Philadelphia area for the past 30 years and am very used to seeing planes. These objects were different. They were not random lights because they seemed to moved in very purposeful, logical  formations and repeated these patterns often. Their speed was much  faster than your average commercial plane, but they did not streak across the sky or anything like that.  Sometimes the formations(triangles, lines, stacked) spanned many miles, sometimes they were closed in. Usually they would expand and contract the formation or move out of the formation into another one. There is an Air Force Base in New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base, perhaps 50 miles away. But these objects did not resemble any miliary aircraft that I every saw.
19970212	19970629	 San Antonio, TX	 triangle	15seconds	Summary : My girlfriend and I report seeing 7 lights in a boomerang shape object going east flying very slowly. The object was about 100 yards up from the ground and about 50 yards wide.The object from us was n/e about 200 yards,with no plane engine sounds.My girlfriend and I were going to the movies when we saw this object. We were at a mall about to go underground to the theatre.When we saw a bunch of lights flickering like a strobelight&apos; with colors of green,blue,red,white,and yellow.We got as close as we can to the object,which was about 200 yards.I got out of the car because I could not figure out what this object was. I could not see a shape just a form of a boomerang that was 50 yards or more wide.It lasted about 15 seconds then trees and buildings blocked our view.There is no way we were the only people to see these lights,they were to bright and the object was to big.The mall we were at was Windsor park mall in the city of SanAntonio next to a smaller city called Windcrest but still Bexar county.It flew over a major street called Walzem Rd.,That&apos;s how I know we were not the only observers.My girlfriend and I only saw it for about 15 seconds but it was going slowly to the east and we were facing northeast. The sun was !just going down behind us, so we were facing the night sky. That&apos;s why we could not see a structure I guest, unless it was 7 different objects flying in a perfect formation with no sounds of engines. I THINK NOT!

19971114	19971115	 Bellingham, WA	 formation	90 seconds	Summary : consistent with behavior of object burning on re-entryI had a 90 second view of the 14 November phenomena from Bellingham Washington.  From my perspective, it was consistent with the theory of space junk burning on re-entry.  I say this because about 100 initial lights gradualy faded out until only the few brightest remained, and they too faded. Some other observations: * I saw point-lights only, without 2 dimensional shape * Multiple colors, blues, reds, golds, and whites * Two major clusters, the larger one above the smaller * Parallel, straight line path, of all lights, no relative lateral motion between the lights, but some traveled faster than others. My advice to folks who want to label this an object of extraterrestrial origin:  Better make sure your theory holds that the object burned up.
19850912	19971010	 La Veta, CO	 circle	6 seconds	Summary : Well what happened was when I was about 5,  I was coming back from a trip from my grandparents. I was looking out the windown and it was very dark. I suddenly saw a object it had lights with a circular pattern It had multiple colored lights mostly Red White &amp; Blue. When I returned home I went over to the tv and turned it on. There was a news report of about 5 sightings of a ufo flashing red white and blue lights. I then kept it inside me till there was this pageIt had lights from my perspective with about a 2 foot per light seperation. It had a distinct pattern of the lights. It went White, Blue, Red. It flashed all the seperate lights at once. I observed it. My background is I am 16 know was 5 at the time have a good social life, very mature and very truthfull.
19970315	19970713	 Kalamazoo, MI	 flash	seconds	Summary : Immense red flash like a very bright red lightning flah.  It lit up the whole sky, the ground and my truck.  It traveled from the ground to the clouds and split up into several parts.Sometime in March in the early morning my friend and I were traveling east on &quot;D&quot; avenue and somewhere around the cross street of N. Westnedge a bright red flash illuminated the whole sky, the ground, everything in the truck, it was like a flash of bright lightning.  The flash was so bright it lit everything as bright as day in red. It originated from the forest to our right, my view of the actual object was blocked by the truck but my friend said he saw something like a beam of light shoot from the ground into the low clouds as it traveled up it seemed to split up into different parts and travel through the clouds.  There were some low clouds around the area that were kind of thick but the whole sky was not covered, there were many parts of the sky that were clear, no thunderstorms or anything.  Though this left us in awe we did not report it to the police.  I just saw the report address in the Battle Creek Enquirer (local newspaper,) so I decided to report it.
19970621	19970727	 London (Chingford Hatch) (UK/England),	 light	1hr 10mins	Summary : On leaving a restaurant awaiting a Taxis, we looked at the sky. It was a Full Moon that night, We saw several spherical lights some of which were in formation of fours and threes.  Headed by slightly larger singular spherical lights which lead each group, these were seen by a waitress, four in the party, and the Taxis driver on his arival. When we arived at our destination, some 15 mins away, the lights were still visable in the sky, we do not know if they were the same lights. They were traverling in an east to west direction and we watch them pass overhead until they disappeared from our veiw at approx. 1-25am.As of above.We reported the event to the magazine &quot; U.F.O Reality &quot;.
19970502	19970505	 Lincoln City (North of), OR	 light	6-8 minutes	Summary : Obj. travelling n/nw at satelite altitude. intermittent (irregular) brilliant white bursts, faded to pale yellow.  2nd obj  w/same m/o as 1st. .  Binocs &amp; t-scope.While stargazing my friend Ron and I observed a brilliant white flash to the south of us.  This was two or three minutes after having sighted a satellite passing from south to north. After an interval of perhaps 15-20 seconds we both observed a second flash and were able to make out object with naked eye.  Appeared very similar to satellite that had just passed.  Observers: ((Name deleted)); financial analyst, amateur astronomer and photgrapher. ((Name deleted)); book keeperWitness to observers; ((Name deleted)); home loan mortgage processor It would then dim to yellow and then pale yellow (about the same intensity as the satelite) and would then burst again. At first, the object was headed due north, then, at about 80 degrees (almost directly overhead) it veered about ten degrees west, then continued in a straight line n/nw.  During its traverse trained his telescope on object.  He has done this many time with aircraft and can make out the navigation lights of such.  This had no visible navigation lights.  The glow, or i!ntensity of light at dim stage, and the comparison to satellites we have observed would put this object at satellite height. No tail observed.  Both of us have seen many aircraft at night and are familiar with what a strobe looks like at great altitude.  This was far more intense and the intermittent nature was not like A/C strobes.  It appeared to accelerate at burst and slow down with dimming? Weird. As the object was about 10 degrees or less from dropping out of our view in the N/NW, a second object appeared to the west of the first at approximately the same distance and displayed the same white burst behavior.  Alternated bursts with first object.
19970313	19970320	 Buckeye, AZ	 sphere	5 MINUTES	Summary : Observed a number (3 - 5) of white/yellow lights hovering (suspended) approximately 7 - 10 miles away.  Observed streaking object leaving one orb and traveling at a high rate of speed in a horizontal manner and leaving a &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;trail&quot; behind (much like a meteor, but in a straight path).  The lights extinguished quickly with no fading of &quot;fizzling-out&quot;.I have been observing these &quot;lights&quot; since approximately August/September, 1996.  I live approximately 4 miles north of Buckeye and in an area that is in a diaganol line approximately 15 - 20 miles south/southwest from Luke Air Force Base.  The first night we observed the lights back in the fall, they appeared due South of my home.  There were three large orbs and were yellow/white in color.  I called to my roomate to come and see and she observed them at that time.  We concluded they were flares of some sort.  However, they disappeared very quickly, as if a switch had been turned off.  A few moments later, they appeared, all at once, in a location several miles to the west of the original sighting.  We were not at all convinced that these lights were unexplainable, and we were mildly curious.The second sighting was perhaps a week later, with the same type of behavior.  This time, however, I retrieved my binoculars and both my roomate and myself wathced the lights for several minutes.  It appeared that there was heat emanating from the orb...we thought it might be smoke, but it appeared more to be like radiant heat.  We assumed that if it was a flare of some time, it would gradually burn out, but once again it exstinguised itself very rapidly and we did not observe it again that night.In visiting with my new neighbors, I asked whether they had seen these lights and they had not.  However, a week or so later, once again they appeared (in the same location), and I called them and had them come outside to observe with myself and my roomate.  They confirmed the sighting, and also thought that perhaps it was some type of flare.  The also observed the heat radiating from the orbs.  They disappeared as before.I am not a very good judge of distance or size, but if I were to estimate the size of these object in relation to the night sky, I would say they appeared to be the size of 1/2 dollar piece.  They have appeared in numbers of 3, 4 and in a configuration of 3 with 2 to west side.I remember two other occasions in which I observed these lights and began to feel that it was some sort of Air Force exercise or some other explainable phenomena.The night of March 13, 1997, I was driving from Phoenix, west on I-10.  I had left town at approximately 7:45 p.m., and am guessing it was around 7:20 to 7:25 that I began to notice the lights.  I remember thinking that the lights were in a different position that I had observed them before.  They were more closely situated near the Estrella Mtns (west side) and seemed to be moving.  Before, I had only observed them being stationery.  It did not really dawn on me that they were moving until I turned South off of the interstate and began traveling south.  I realized that the lights had moved to the location I was used to seeing them...approximately 20 miles west of the Estrella Mts.By the time I was within one mile of my home, I began to sense that these lights were moving much more erratically than I had previously observed.  They had moved even further west (it was approximately 7:25 - 7:30 by this time) and suddenly I saw the streaking object seemingly coming from one of the larger orbs (there were 3 at this time) and move VERY rapidly horizontally across the sky (to the northwest I believe).  It seemed there was a tail of sparks or matter coming from this smaller object and I can only compare it to a meteor, although I am certain it was NOT a meteor (it moved in a straight line and then went out very quickly some distance from the orb). I ran into the houseand summoned my roomate, but by the time we went outside, all signs of the objects were gone.I began asking people at work back in Aug/Sept if they had seen any of these lights.  I suppose they thought I was a bit touched, but now that this major sighting has occured, they are remembering the days I came in with details of what I had seen the night before.  I wish I would have known how to contact someone back then.I am a Data Processing Assistant (15 years) with a large school district in Phoenix. If you would be interested in any other information or background information on myself or the other &quot;witnesses&quot; please contact me via email.  Thank you for providing this service.
19971114	19971114	 Seattle, WA	 formation	5 - 8 seconds	Summary : Siting at stop light on Alaskan Way, heading west.  Streaks of lights came flying across the sky, coming from over the Puget Sound.  They were flying in a straight, direct path heading northerly.  Bright white lights, long tails of light that appeared to dissipate and then return; almost as if there were streaks of smoke or haze along with the lights.  Seemed to be three or four large ones and several small ones all flying in the same pattern.  Didn&apos;t appear to be a meteor shower as the flight path was not headed in a downward gravitational manner.  Shape was difficult to distinguish.  Most distinguished features were the tails as the lights would disappear and then return.Musician/Kitchen Manager, long time resident of Seattle Tennis Coach/Management Consultant, part-time resident of Seattle and Phoenix, AZ (witnesses big sighting of UFO over Phoenix earlier this year)
19630801	19971119	 Amsterdam, NY	 disk	3-4 min.	Summary : Observed 2 saucer shaped objects, traveling at high speed, vertically and horizontally.Staying with friends whose home was in the country.  No surrounding light.  I Awoke out of a sound sleep, went to the window and was looking out when I observed a round, large object with visible bluish-green lights around the bottom of the object.  It was charging back and forth and up and down at a very fast speed.  At that time I woke my husband to view this, and we then both witnessed a second, idenically shaped object approaching the first one.  Together they would go up and down and after a minute or so they both took off at a very high speed.  I called the local police station and asked if they had received and reports on strange events in the shy, and the officer stammered and him- hawed around and finally said &quot;no Ma&apos;M&quot;  I could tell he was obviously not telling the truth.  Also the friends we were staying with had had a more spectacular experience about 10 months prior to this one.  They had a greenhouse, and one night as they were potting plants a large round object hovered over them, above the greenhouse.  At that time they became immobilized.  After a couple of minutes, this object soundlessly lifted off and flew away.  At this point our friends were once again able to move.  Out friends at this time were mature, 50+ people.  They were honest and never would have made anything like this up.  The wife had told me the story, only after making me promise never to let her husband know she had told me.  He rightfully thought that at time, people would think he was crazy.  They have both now passed on so I feel free to relate their experience.
19951015	19971006	 Woodstock, CT		5 seconds	Summary : Young couple witness large glowing craft streak across the night sky, as if it were &quot;exiting&quot; the Earth. Craft was followed by a trail of pearlescent light, objected started in NE hor.streaked to about 1/2 way across hor. Then apparently flew straight out of the earth! Without a trace.  It took a total of three quick &quot;oh my gods!&quot; and it was over. Definitely not a comet!On October 15, 1995 my boyfriend and myself were on our way to meet some of our friends. It was roughly around 10:00-10:15p.m. We realized that we were a bit early to meet them so we decided to just drive around for a while.  The radio in the car was on but very quietly.  We drove around for about 10 minutes or so and then decided to start heading to meet our friends.  We were traveling north on Senexet Road in Woodstock, CT.  I was the passenger, my boyfriend was the driver. My eyes were suddenly drawn to a small glowing light, seemingly the size of a street lamp, but much brighter.  Almost as quickly as I noticed it, it started heading in a southern direction (towards us). It&apos;s speed was phenomenal, never in all my years (26 to be exact) have I ever seen anything in the sky (day or night) travel at such an incredible speed. The closest that this ball of light came to our location was within about 1/2 mile.  Upon reaching that point the object appeared much larger than I had originally thought, it was then that I realized that this was not a plane, helicopter, meteor or comet.  All of which I have witnessed before in the night sky.  If one were to get close enough to be able to measure the size of the object my guess would be that they find it to be probably close to a 1/4 of a mile long and about half as wide.  Once it reached the closest point that it had come to us,it came to an abrupt stop. Then, in less than a second, it turned, as if effortlessly, 90 degrees toward the west and continued at the previous rate of speed until about half way across the horizon.  It then again stopped abruptly and turned another 90 degrees, this time to the north and as quiclky as if it had never stopped it took off, again this time it appeared as if it left the earth completely!  Once the object made its first turn towards the west we noticed that it had an incredibly long, pearlescent colored trail of light traveling behind it.  This was perhaps the most striking thing that I remember about the object.  It was the most beautiful yet strangest light we have ever witnessed. The trail of light, judging by the distance and size from our location appeared to be atleast 15 to 20 miles long!  And as bright as the daylight!  We didn&apos;t tell that many people what we had seen for obvious reasons.  When I finally contacted a U.F.O. investigative firm, They said there was a bright meteor in that area around that time of the month.  I told the guy he was nuts, that I know a meteor when I see one.  I said to him,&quot;besides, meteors fall down, not up! And they don&apos;t travel at speed in excess of thousands of miles per hour!&quot;  He asked how I knew how fast it was going? I told him that in order for that object to travel from one end of the horizon to the middle of the horizon and then out of the atmosphere in less than 3 &quot;oh, my gods!&quot; it had to be traveling faster than anything humans have thus far invented. For a plane to travel the distance that this object traveled in less than 5 seconds, it would take about 20 to 25 minutes!  When the object made its first turn and we saw the trail of light for the first time, I had the most incredible tingling sensation come over my body and my eyes started to water and my muscles all felt tense, my boyfriend experienced similar sensations. We are both in our mid-twenties have two children, good jobs and absolutely no reason to make anything like this up.  Feel free to post this event, I am no longer worried that people will think I&apos;m crazy.  After all, maybe I am crazy, but I&apos;m definitely not STUPID!  I know what I saw was without a doubt a U.F.O.
19971031	19971101	 Santa Ana, CA	 light	2 min.	Summary : Saw an orange, round object in the northern sky under clear conditions. Object was flickering in brightness and was moving very slowly through the air. It appeared something was falling from the bottom of the craft towards the earth.the UFO was witnessed by three other people and myself. We were standing in front of my friends place of employment when one of my friends looked up and said &quot;what the hell is that?&quot; The three of us looked up and saw what appeared to be an orange ball slowly moving across the sky. At this time, a customer came up and saw what we were looking at and said the same thing. &quot;what the hell is that.&quot; My first impression was that it was a plane that caught on fire. But by observing it more. It appeared to be moving too slowly to be an airplane. Right about this time, we all observed what appeared to be projectiles coming out from underneath the ball traveling down toward the earth. The object then started to dim in brightness and get brighter again. It did this several times. I then assumed it might be a flare but it was traveling in a straight line. the object stayed visible for about 2 or 3 minutes before it slowly faded from sight. I am an office employee that works in Santa Ana. My friends work a right down the street from me.. This is where the sighting took place at. After debating what we had seen for two hours, none of us could come up with any rational explanation of what we saw. Thank you.

19730724	19970319	 Blackfoot, ID	 triangle	Approx. 4 minutes	Summary : Smooth, rounded triangular object, stone grey, no lights or markings, dome on bottom, silent.I was &apos;camping&apos; in the backyard of my friend of the time in the Blackfoot Idaho of 1973.My friend told me there was a UFO in the sky, come look. I figured he was lying. He became deathly serious, and told me that if I did not look, I would regret it forever. His tone scared me, so I looked.Up in the 3 am sky was a smoothly moving object. It was the size of my right thumbnail on my outstretched hand.The object was perfectly silent, a rounded, smoothly contoured equal edged triangle. It appeared to have either a dome shaped hollow or protrusion in the middle bottom. There were no lights, seams, markings, or details whatsoever.It appeared as though cast of one solid piece of material. It was the grey of stone, and was visible by virtue of the reflected glow of city streetlights upon it. It moved in a perfectly straight line, with no &apos;point&apos; of the triangle facing the direction of travel exactly. Near the zenith of our view, it suddenly altered direction without curving or slowing down.One second it was going one way, the next instant it was moving about 35 degrees or so another way. It contined on this slow, smoothand straight new path, until it was lost to sight behind trucks parked near us. I saw the object go past telephon and power lines, it was above and behind them.My friend and I decided not to speak about it, but instead to immediately go inside the house, and seperately draw and describe the event on paper, then exchange the papers.We though this would let us know that what we saw was &apos;real&apos;. Our reports to each other, when finished, were identical, except for one difference.I had thought the dome on the bottom was a &apos;hollow&apos;, not unlike the &apos;dimple&apos; in red blood cells, while he thought the dome protruded outwards from the rounded shape. I ascribe this to the difficulty of percieving an unfamiliar contoured shape in reflected light from distance.The event lasted approximately 4 minutes in total, from the time I started looking, to the time the object glided silently beyond our vision.During the event I measured the object with my thumb, and closed my eyes briefely to see if it would still be there when I opened them, it was.The sky was perfectly clear, and the stars shone brightly. Our shared yard was surrounded on all sides by large trucks, houses, a fence, and trees, making for a perfect viewing environment,with no directly visible light sources to spoil our view. I was 13 years old at the time, my friend was 14.I have never forgotten this sight. It was utterly unique. I have no feeling or impression whatsoever about what the object actually was. It could have been anything from ship to lifeform to paradimentionalprotrusion to shared, perfect hallucination. Any of these explanations are equally fantastic. It simply...was. Featureless, solid, grey, and oblivious tothe way objects are supposed to move.I have not seen anything else, since. I have certainly seen nothing else like it.It taught me a few things: one, that during a genuine sighting it is utterly impossible to hope to realistically describe thesize of a UFO, as there is no yardstick by which to measure it, save one&apos;s own arm, or a nearby object. Against the starry sky,such a thing could have been any size (within reason) and almost any distance away. There is litterally no way to tell.Therefore I discount the tales of folks who claim to know the distance and size of an utterly unfamiliar object.Lastly, I feel a little cheated. In the years that followed this event, I have heard many tales of UFO sightings, all with fancy lights,weird sounds, strange feelings, and so forth. My sighting was not so spectacular, just a blank, seamless impossibility,moving silently. It did at least move in an impossible manner, which is at least something!I cannot remember my friends name after all these years, alas. I hope that this report may cause him to contact me,so that I can reminisce about this event.
19971114	19971124	 Burnaby (Canada), BC	 delta	60 sec.	I live on Burnaby Mountain and noticed a large, well lit flying wedged shaped object flying very low over my house without any noise. It was flying at a fast and consistant pace, heading towards the North East. It startled me as I caught a glimpse of it from my bedroom window, as it&apos;s unsual to have jets fly that low over my house and usually there is the accompanying sound. There were many lights outlining the wedge shape. They seemed to be about the same brightness although some appeared to be reddish while others blue. It is hard to describe something that is so unusual, as I don&apos;t have any frame of reference for it. It definitely appeared to be travelling similar to aircraft, as it travelled in a consistent and fluid manner towards the northeast and out of sight within a minute or so. I was listening to the radio at the time and heard the announcement that some space debris had been reported flying over the lower mainland. While listening to the Art Bell show on Sat. Nov! 22, it was requested that anyone who had a close view of the object send in a report. I hope that this report will be helpful. I am curious as to why the media reports stated that the debris fell into the pacific ocean, as the object was heading away from the ocean?
0000	19971007	 Williston, ND	 formation	30 mins	Summary : Winter of 61-62 or 62-63; large illuminated white lite with several small blue lites converging to and then dimming and leaving almost straight up at tremendous speed. Local radio station flooded with calls Would like to know why never heard about since???I was driving semi at the time and approaching Williston from the east after dark.Since this happened about 35 years ago I dont recall the date or time, but do know what I saw. I watched what I first thought to be a farm yard lite until I realized it was moving. When it appeared to be over Williston is when it flared up as stated previously and the smaller blue lites; coming from different directions converged on it. Just curious???
19950606	19970417	 Golden, CO	 other	15 minutes	Summary : Witnessed a Barbell like object that rotated irratically, changed directions several times, and finally dissapeared.I just found this web page, and when I saw the report logs, I excitedly went to June 1995. There is a report of an object seen on the 7th in another state that is remarkably similar to what I observed on June  1995. The other witnesses, who were my co-workers did not report this event, as we did not know how to go about doing so. The following is an account of what we saw. The details are not hazy in my memory, as they are burned into my mind- they could never be forgotten.I work at a Bungee jump tower in Golden CO. I am the supervisor of five employees that run the jump tower each day. At 6pm, one of my employees remarked how the clouds in the sky, when observed from the ground with the backdrop of the tower, made the tower appear to move.(the wind was blowing the clouds) I looked up, along with another employee, and noticed that this was true. Gazing at the sky behind the tower, something caught my eye. At first I thought it was an airplane, as it appeared to be at the same altitude as a plane taking off from DIA would. But then it abruptly changed directions. I pointed this out to the other employees. We then observed the object for about ten or fifteen minutes. The object was reflecting the sunlight, and therefore was flashing in the daytime sun. After five minutes or so, it appeared that the object was getting closer. We could then tell that the object appeared to be a metallic shaft with two round ends, like a barbell. The flashing was cau!sed by the object rotating irratically, and wobbling back and forth. I suggested that it was simply two mylar balloons caught in the wind, but then we noticed the same clouds previously mentioned, and the object was moving opposite these wind blown clouds, ruling out the balloon idea. Then, after approximately seven minutes of observation the object changed directions and headed back the opposite direction. The object did not seem to be getting closer at this point, but we then noticed a faint greyish foggy halo surrounding the object. At this point two customers came to the jump, and inquired as to what we were gaping at. They observed the object as well. After a maximum of fifteen tense minutes of observing this anomoly, the object changed course abruptly, went behind a small, thin, transparent cloud, and dissapeared. I would appreciate any information regarding this sitghting, i.e. whether the similar sighting in your log is of similar circumstances. Since 1995 I have been w!rithing to get this reported, and am very grateful for this service.
19970405	19970719	 Fairhope, AL	 circle	1 minute	Summary : Man walking dog sees tire-shaped object w/windows. No sound, no animal reaction.1997 040X 1400 D Fairhope, AL, US FINAL REPORT The following was obtained by telephone interview with the witness on April 21, 1997. The sighting took place on or about April 5, 1997 in Fairhope, Alabama (Baldwin County) at 2:00 pm (central time). The witness reported this sighting to the Fairhope Courier and to Clompton Jones of MUFON. The details reported to those sources varies from those reported to this writer. This investigator cannot account for those variances. The witness stated he was walking his dog on the streets of Fairhope on a Saturday afternoon, although the witness, when pressed, could not remember the exact date. He believes April 5 to be the approximate date. The witness reported the weather as &quot;sunny and clear,&quot; with a breeze. The witness stated he was walking west toward Mobile Bay. As he was about to cross the street, the witness observed the object west of his position (in front of the witness), at an elevation of approximately 30 . The object was reported to be &quot;the length of the Fairhope pier&quot; from the witness, and was drifting very slowly to the north. After viewing the object for 30 seconds to one minute, the object continued to move north and disappeared behind foliage. No sound was reported. There was no reaction from his dog. The object was described as &quot;generally tire-shaped,&quot; round, light greyish-beige in color, with a row of 8 to 10 square black windows with a blue frame around them. The apparent size of the object was reported to be the same as an object one inch long held at arm&apos;s length. No other external details, appendages, etc. were reported. This case was initially investigated by Ross VonVolkenburg (MUFON). Duncan Crow obtained a telephone interview with the witness and submitted this report.
19970323	19970805	 Tigard, OR	 diamond	1 second	Summary : Large, black, diamond-kite shaped objectI was looking up to view the comet from my driveway when I saw an object approaching from the Northern horizon.  Its speed was at least 500 Knots and it seemed to be accelerating as it passed directly overhead. It was  at about 2500 feet AGL and climbing. Its heading was 170 degrees.  It appeared to be at least 400 feet wide and 700 feet long. Its size and speed were difficult to judge because it was totally silent and it traveled from the Northern to Southern horizon so quickly. It had a faint purple glow along its leading and trailing edges, and had a series of luminous red-pink box like sections along the belly at the front. I&apos;ve been trying to convince myself for the past five months that it was some top secret aerospace plane prototype.  I have never seen anything like it, and I am fairly familiar with aircraft.  I have no interest in defending the credibility of my experience, I saw it and it was weird, period.
19970428	19970510	 Houston, TX	 light	30 seconds	Summary : My wife and I witnessed around 10 to 13 amber  lights flying in a &apos;V&apos; formation at a high rate of speed over Houston.My wife and I had just stepped out of our apartment in west Houston to try and see if the comet was still out.  She noticed some lights in the sky, which she said were in the shape of a kite.  When she told me to look, I  saw what looked to be a large triangle in the western sky.  As the lights moved toward us and toward Houston, I realized there were around 10 to 13 individual amber colored lights flying in a perfect &quot;V&quot; formation.  They were going extremely fast, and seemed to be at a very high altitude.   They passed to the south of us, and as they neared Houston,  started shifting positions.  Once over the downtown area, we started losing sight because of the lights of the city, but the lights appeared to stop.  As soon as this happened, we bolted for the video camera. On our return, we could no longer see them.  The  time from sighting in the west until they were over downtown was around 30 seconds or so.  I did some rough estimates of speed based on where I thought the!y were at first (Sealy??).  No jet flies at ~10,000 mph.I am an electrical engineer from ((Name deleted)) University by education (War Eagle!), and I work at ((Name deleted)) as a programmer.  My wife is a  student at University of Houston.  This was the first truly bizarre thing either of us has witnessed.

I pretty much blew it off until I saw a report on the local news about Thursday nights lights.  I&apos;m embarrased I didn&apos;t listen, and jealous I didn&apos;t see it myself.Lights were white in color and seemed to be straight overhead.

19970704	19970707	 Historic St. Charles Riverfront, MO	 oval	Fire Works Display	Summary : Oval-shaped ball of bright light (bluish-green) dashed through the sky at a high speed then disappeared within seconds.My father, stepmother, friend, and I were on the riverfront at Historic St. Charles.  We were all seated on the same blanket and looking into the sky.  A little off center from directly above us a bright flash of light, somewhat bluish-green, streamed through the sky.  It took the shape of a small oval.  It was moving at a fairly high rate of speed.  Then within about two seconds the light disappeared.  Everyone in my party and including a friend of my father&apos;s who was also at the same event saw it.  I thought it could be a firework malfunction but no sound can from it and it was located far from the barge where the fireworks were being launched.  The fireworks that were shot off didn&apos;t even come close to the place in the sky where the ball of light was minutes before located.  The light also moved horizontally through the sky.

19971112	19971113	 Seattle, WA	 light	8 seconds	Summary : Looked up in the sky in a S-SW direction.  Noticed 2 &quot;stars&quot; that were moving together at the same speed.  They traveled for about 3 seconds and then they both dimmed away.Upon looking into the sky in a S-SW direction I first noticed 2 objects that looked like stars or satellites moving together at the same speed.  They were high up in the sky at about the 10-11 o&apos; clock position.  They were moving about the same speed a satellite would appear to be moving.  They were bright white and moved in a downward westerly direction and then somewhat rapidly dimmed out completely.  Then I noticed a brighter star about a full moons distance away from the last position of the other two.  This was was much brighter and slowly moved in a downward westerly direction and it also slowly dimmed out and dissappeared.  I made a few calls to 911 and the FAA and no one had hear anything about this sighting.  I then called the King 5 TV news tip line and talked to a lady who said that they were just starting to recieve calls about some weird lights in the sky. She contacted me later in the evening -9:30pm- and told me that qiute a few people called in to report this.  They were unable to come to any conclusions as to what this may have been.

19970601	19970601	 Houston, TX	 other	13 minutes	Summary : 3 objects at 30,000 ft traveling ssw at about600-700 mphmyself(Name deleted) and two of my co-workers were in the smoke pen at the refinery we work at as pumpers(lyondell-citgo refining,12000 lawndale,houston,tx) when we observed three objects at 30000-35000 ft traveling ssw at 1945 hours atabout 600-700 mph. the three objects were about 1-1 1/2 miles apart and were dark brown in appearance. they appeared to be about the size of a small apple in size,but i know they were much bigger for we were a great distance from the objects, if you understand what im saying. there was no vapor trail or sound,and there were no telltale blinking as regular aircraft are prone to do. we watched for about 13-15 minutes until all three passed thru the lower portion of a cloud and never reappeared on the other side coming out. there were clouds in the area,but there was more area devoid of clouds than otherwise. ive had three other sitings back in &apos;94, and i reported them to hufon and mufon, but got no response. they were much better sitings with more definition than the ones i and my co-workers saw today. if anyone else saw the objects today,please let me know,as i would like confirmation from someone else
19970704	19970708	 Fairview Heights, IL	 light	2 seconds	Summary : A blue light seen overhead moving east to west,very fast.It was not fireworks.We were on the way to watch the St.Louis  fireworks.My son(8),my two brothers and myself. getting into the Jeep looked up and saw it. It was light bue in color very small     with a blue wisp of tail air. starry night. The observers are myself a manager at an ice cream store in Caseyville, IL. One brother is a manager wal-mart in a department of this store in Memphis, TN. one brother is an assistant manager of The Dollar Tree Store in Memphis, TN. My 8 year old son is a third grader at Illini Elementary School Fairview Heights, IL. My brothers were up to visit for the holiday.
19760815	19970623	 McDermitt (NE of;  Lat 42 05&apos;N  Lon 117 00&apos;W, NV	 cylinder	3-5 min	Summary : 5 witness long tubular shaped object moving S to N low to the ground with 6-7 oval lights.  The first and last lights were colored red, others were white.  No vertical stabilizer or wings.The object was moving south to north at about 200&apos; AGL.  It was a long (B-52 length) tubular shaped gray object with 6 or 7 oval shaped lights about 3 times the size of a commercial plane window.  The first and last lights were red in color, the others (middle) were white.  There was no vertical stabilizer (tailfin) and no visible wings.  The sighting was planform (from the side) so it is possible there may have been wings of some kind washed out in the bloom from the lights.  It was low to the ground at about 3/4 - 1 mile moving with no visible propulsion (exhaust) and made no noise.  We noticed it as it was abeam (closest point of movement) us and watched it as it moved North over a ridge.  It was moving relatively slow (about 80 - 100 kts reflecting back with my current experience) and was in view for about 3 minutes.  The aspect of it never changed; meaning the lights were visible pointing at us.The sighting took place near a remote cow-camp near the Idaho, Oregon, Nevada border back in Aug of 1976.  It was about 4:30 pm, 3 hrs before sunset with a high (about 25000 agl) scattered layer of clouds.  The observers were myself and my brother, age 7 &amp; 5 respectively, my father, age 50 at the time, and two Piahute Indians, one about 35yrs old and the other was 8.  The sighting was in the vicinity of IR-300 (Instrument Route) which is frequented by AF B-52&apos;s which is what we thought it was at first.  My father was a high school counselor with a masters degree and the older indian was a high school english teacher with a BA.  With the recent uprise of UFO ism in America, my father prompted me to submit this and helped me fill in the gaps of my young memory, which is still quite vivid.  I myself am now a carrier pilot in the Navy and have exhausted any skepticism that I had growing up of what I actually saw.  Much of which came from the two Piahute Indians I was with who ar!e extremely superstitious and would not talk about the sighting, nor acknowledge what it was at the time.  My younger brother, now 25 has a slight memory of the sighting as well.Sorry this is so long coming.  Just got internet.  Can draw picture if interested.
19971007	19971215	 MM82/MM83 (between, on I-80), PA	 circle	5 minutes	Summary : Driving west on i-80 ufo was hovering about 100 ft off ground less than 50 ft from interstate.It was about 200yds in diameter and the underside was very visible.It was very dark grey or black nonreflective material.There were two geometric sections of square windows? that were each 5 x 3 in a concave portion of the body.One section of six of the same size on a convex portion separating the two above sections.Also there was a larger (8x8)square section of very intense white light in the center section.In a 40mph side wind it was motionless and silent at about 100 ft off the ground.Also the CB in my truck would not even key up for the next 5 miles and the fm radio would not work.Also the military may already be aware of this since I saw a helicopter at 5-10 mi west of the ufo.the ufo was still there when I left.The outside shape of the ufo although basically a round shape the edge curved in and out about every 50ft and was perfectly contoured so there was not a flat spot on the entire underside of the ship.To a casual observer the whole ufo could be easily missed as the color blends well with the night sky along with its motionless and silent hovering.There was no activity that I could see on ,around or coming from the lighted apertures.(windows or engines?)The ufo was close to an overpass that did not connect to the interstate.There was only one and I was a little apprehensive about walking up closer and we were on a tight delivery schedule.
19970313	19970319	 Phoenix, AZ	 chevron	10 minutes	Summary : &quot;V&quot; shaped black object with 5 lights, passed directlyover our house in Phoenix and didn&apos;t make a sound. It&apos;s shape was that of a carpenter&apos;s square set at about 60 degrees, each arm about 300 feet long.My 10 year old son and I had just arrived hope about 8pm and as he waited in the car for me to come around and open the door, he was looking towards the Northwest to see if the comet might still be visible, when he saw a grouping of lights. I looked and what I saw was what looked like at first a pattern of 5 lights in a half oval on its up side. I thought it was a blimp with lights on it. It seemed to be floating but I noticed it was coming directly in our direction. My son went in the house and got my wife, my 13 year old grandson and my 18 year old daughter, to come outside. We all watched these lights approach. Whatever it was it was moving rather slowly. As it came close it no longer had an up-oval shape, but began to look more lie a &quot;V&quot; of 5 lights, with one light in the center lead point and two lights on each side. The angle of the &quot;V&quot; was not very sharp, maybe 60 degrees.As we stood there watching we were completely flabergasted because it was going to pass directly over our house.  And it did. It passed directly over head maybe a thousand or so feet overhead. Our house is up on the side of a mountain in the Northeast part of Phoenix and we can see pretty far to the northwest and southwest. When it passed overhead we all were looking at it and talking. For one thing, it seemed to float over us and it made absolutely no detectable sound at all.  We were trying to imagine what it was. It certainly couldn&apos;t be a group of aircraft flying in formation, because the lights remained absolutely fixed in relationship with each other. As we looked up we could see through the middle of the &quot;V&quot; but each arm seemed to be flat shaped like a ruler, and rather long from the first lead light to the tip lights, maybe a couple of hundred feet or more. It was huge.The kids got a little frightened, I suppose because we had no explanation for what we were seeing. We watched it continue to fly towards the southeast until we no longer could see any lights.My background: I am 54 years old, in perfect health. I have a Masters Degree from Columbia University Teacher&apos;s College. Formerly worked for IBM as a systems engineer. More recently worked in the electronics repair industry in management. Presently executive in a manufacturing firm. My wife is a secretary at St Mary&apos;s Catholic High School. My one daughter is an honor student at the High School. We live up on the side of this mountain and are always looking at the sky, so if we&apos;re outside not much is going to go by without us seeing it. And we all have never seen anything like this.

19630615	19971127	 Jonesboro (Arkansas State University), AR	 cigar	6 hours +	Summary : First appeared the disc over building on campus at dusk, then a sonic boom from air base 50 miles away. Craft zoomed up until it became star size. Cigar craft appeared with 13 craft flying at sharp angles in and out of cigar craft. I watched with campus police and hundreds of other students until after midnight. A friend called home and the base had gone on alert. Photos were taken by other students. Next day local paper was full of the sightings.Not sure if this was ever reported .The first craft was disc shaped with dome on top. Cigar shaped craft was several hundred times the size of the craft. Remember its been some time since I witnessed this event. Has this been reported by anyone else?
19680225	19970305	 Ironwood, MI	 sphere	20 minutes	Summary : A small UFO we chased in a Piper Cherokee plane.  Object led us in a circle then passed below us.Four of us (3 pilots) just had landed at the Gogebic County Airport, and while taxing back toward the hanger noticed a flashing yellow light about 2 miles southwest of the airport.  We took off again on runway 27 and headed straight at the object.  It continued to flash a yellowish white light in no particular sequence.  As we approached it, it headed east (our left).  We turned to follow it, but it kept staying off our left wingtip.  It led us in a complete 360 degree turn.  It then headed east along a range of hills.  It entered the landing pattern for the airport at 800 ft above ground level.  We followed it.  It completed the downwind pattern, but after turning onto the dogleg, instead of entering final approach, it veered at a 45 degree angle and passed underneath us.  We were at 800 feet above the ground at the time, in the downwind leg of the landing pattern.  When we finally got turned around, the object had disappeared.  Witnesses on the ground with whom we were in !radio contact with claimed the object passed above us, then just zoomed upward at a steep angle and disappeared.  We knew the object passed beneath us.  The object appeared to be a yellowish-white light about 5 feet in diameter.  When it passed below us, it did not appear any larger and there was no sign that it may have possibly been larger.  Three of us in the plane were licensed pilots, one a commercial airline pilot.  Witnesses on the ground included the airport manager, a local government official and two other pilots.  This encounter was reported to the University of Colorado UFO study which was the offical reporting place at the time.  I received a letter from the project coordinator, Mr. Robert J. Low on March 8, 1968.  He stated that the report would be included in the their active file.  I was informed a few days later by the airport manager, that he had received a telephone call from the University of Colorado asking for more details about the sighting, which he pro!vided.  He was also asked about us, were we creditable witnesses, etc.  He stated that he told them that we all were good honest witnesses.  I never heard anything more about this other than a small article in the local newspaper.  I was wondering if you have ever had any reports similar to this one.  If you have, please advise me of them and where I can read them.  If you need any more information, please contact me.  I have the letter from the University of Colorado and several other items concerning the sighting.
19970812	19970813	 Grand Rapids, MI	 light	1 hr 20 mins	Summary : Small distant white light floating about the east side of Grand Rapids during the night.  Flashing green and red lights, not much movement, but aparently a UFO because it was gone less than an hour later.  Had small movements, but kept generally steady and remained in the same location for over a half hour.The object was a white light with green and red flashing lights.  The white light appered to blink on and off, or just different brightness.  Well I was sitting at a local school at about midnight when I looked up and noticed the flashing lights.  When I began to study it more, I noticed that it was not a plane because it wasn&apos;t moving.  I thought that I saw it moving up and down swiflty but not more than just a little, so maybe my eyes were just shifting.  Then I thought that it was just a star blinking.  So I called the police department, and they told me serveral other people had reported the same incident.  Well, I wasn&apos;t sure then.  I got a friend and showed him, he didn&apos;t believe that it was a UFO, he said it was just a star.  So I gave it up, I mean who would believe that I saw a UFO anyways.  So I went on AOL for a while, and I went back out to check it at 2:30 am, and it was gone.  No trace of the object anywhere.  How many stars can disappear like that.  So I came ! here to report it as soon as I was convinced. As far as I know, there was only one object.  I only saw one that is.  And it really didn&apos;t have any shape.  I mean it did look like it was very far away.  A coulpe of things, there was another star on the west horizon, which the police thought I was seeing, and it wasn&apos;t it.  And there was a meteior shower tonight, but It wasn&apos;t that either.  So people might try to say I&apos;m seeing things, but I know what I saw. I&apos;m an 18 year old male, fresh out of high school.  I&apos;ll be attending college in the fall.  I&apos;ve always belived in UFO&apos;s, in fact I think that they aren&apos;t friendly.  They might be nice, but why would they be so secret in learning about us.  I&apos;m not mentally retarded, in fact I graduated the third highest GPA in my class.  I was not drunk nor high on anything.  My friends will prove that to you that I&apos;m not into that junk.  Well, I&apos;ve said enough, believe if you want to.  But be prepared whent he truth comes out, I think you&apos;ll be shocked.
19970709	19970710	 Olathe, KS	 light	5 min.	Summary : As I was travelling west on 135th. St. between Antioch and Pflumm, I Noticed to my left a trio of lights which were strobing.  The lights were in a diamond shape, two ruby red lights at the upper two corners, and a brilliant white at the lower point.  The white light would pulse twice, then dim, and then the red lights would pulse and then dim.  The object was travelling from the southeast to the northwest.  My vehicle was travelling about 45 m.p.h. and after watching the object for about two minutes it passed over the road just in front of me continueing its course.  This was not a plane.  I observed no green marker lights.
19971114	19971115	 Edmonds, WA	 formation	1.5 minutes	Summary : Mass of lights moving simultaneously from west to east.I was driving west on 196th St SW,in Edmonds, when I noticed a mass of bright lights in the sky to my north.  I could not identify what they were.  At first I thought they were a squadron of helicoptors flying in formation with their lights on.  I immediately pulled over and got out of my truck.  I looked up and saw the mass, moving very slowly to the east.  It looked to be about 3,000 feet off of the ground.  There was no engine noise. It moved at a steady pace until it got to the tree tops to my right(east) and then dissappeared.  I have seen many meteor showers and this was not like anything I have seen in 15 years of living in the desert southwest.  The lights did not arc.  They all moved in unison and steady.  They did not change course.  Today, the official explanation from the Pentagon, is that it was a &quot;Russian rocket&quot; which crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington.  Why was it heading towards eastern Washington?  If it was space junk, it would have had to be enormous.  It covered about 25% of the visible sky. Which makes me think it was lower.

19971029	19971109	 Childress (North of), TX	 sphere	10 seconds	I submitted this report last week, but haven&apos;t seen it posted, so I thought it may have been lost in the shuffle.  Incidentally, as a commercial pilot, I have flown this route from Oklahoma City to Roswell, NM about 50 times.   Nothing like this has ever happened before. On the afternoon of Oct. 29, 1997, I flew my three teenagers from Shawnee, Ok. to Roswell, N.M., to attend their Grandmothers funeral. (My ex-wife&apos;s mother)  I dropped them off at the airport, had my aircraft refueled, and departed Roswell at approx. 1600 Mountain daylight time.   (ROW tower should have the exact departure time in their logs.  My aircraft registration number is N9229A) I climbed to a cruising altitude of 9,500 feet, and settled in for the three and a half  hour, non-stop flight back to Shawnee, Ok.  The sun set about an hour later, and left me with a beautiful, star lit night, tail winds, and no turbulence.  Two hours into the flight, at approx. 1900 CDT, and about 10-20 miles north of Childress, Tx.,  (I was at 70 DME southwest of the Hobart VOR, on the 240 radial) I saw what at first I thought to be a &quot;falling star&quot;.   I was amazed that it didn&apos;t burn up in the first second or two after becoming visible, while traveling from an extremely high altitude, nearly vertical towards the ground.  I remember thinking to myself that I could have made a wish on this one!   The object descended vertically until reaching my altitude, when it suddenly leveled off, and while traveling from east to west, still at what I would have to call &apos;meteorite speed&apos;, veered slightly to the north, before arcing back to the south, on a direct collision course with my! aircraft.  I remember at this point, saying to myself in awe two or three times, that nothing goes this fast!!!    As the object approached my airplane at very high speed, it appeared to grow from &apos;shooting star size&apos;,  until it was about the size of a beach ball held at arms length, when I in a panic, banked hard to the right, (taking the object out of my field of view) to avoid a &quot;collision&quot;.   I never saw the object again after that.   I wanted to call Fort Worth Center (ATC) to see if they had &quot;painted any targets&quot; in my area, but was so shaken up by the event, that when I tried to find the frequency on my charts, it was simply too overwhelming to look at the charts, and control the airplane at the same time.  I was about 60 miles west of Altus AFB, so it is possible the control tower saw this same object.  I&apos;m certain it at least streaked from east to west that far.
19970614	19970625	 Austin, TX	 triangle	15-20 secs	Summary : Trianglular lighted object sighted over Austin Texas 6-14-97 at 11:20 pm.Seen from the intersection of Hwy. 71 and Hwy. 620, near Bee Cave.

I was facing West;  think it was traveling East/Northeasterly, at a moderate rate of speed.  I saw a small airplane just prior to that, flying Northwesterly, with obvious plane lighting, red/green light on the wing tips and white lights on the wings.The triangular objects lights were very bright and as it began to fly over my left shoulder, one of the lights shown down brightly into my eyes.  These lights were much brighter then normal aircraft lights.The object appeared to be several thousand feet high.

ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE THE ENTIRE AREA WAS LIT BY A VERY BRIGHT BLUE-GREEN LIGHT FOR 3-5 SECONDS. AFTER THE LIGHT WAS GONE I LOOKED OUTSIDE THE CAR BUT DID NOT SEE ANYTHING ELSE. BEING THE FORTH OF JULY I PRESUMED IT WAS SOME SORT OF FIREWORKS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIGHT. THE DRIVE-IN WAS ALMOST FULL WITH APPROXIMATELY 100-150 CARS.
19970615	19970622	 Westport, CT	 other	Ext. Fast	Summary : Two men in 20&apos;s, witness a beam of greenish light on merritt parkway.  maybe metor, very fast and split in two right over us.We are two men in late 20&apos;s business perfessionals.  Looked like maybe a metor.  very fast and very bright!  a greenish look.  we were in car travelling about 55 mph.  it stood out, and split apart and continued across the horizon.  hard to say the height of it.  but it was close enough to notice the light instantly.  it was pretty large.  again it had a neonish green appearence!
19970315	19970318	 Oakton, VA	 delta	15 seconds	Summary : I saw two large bright round white lights moving forward together but keeping the same distance apart.  Then the two lights changed direction. Then I saw what appeared to be the bottom of a large moving object.  It was covered with rows of lights, mostly white lights and a few red lights.The two bright white lights appeared at night outside my house.  Then they turned across the backyard. It was very quiet.  Then when I went outside and looked up into the sky I saw rows of much smaller white lights mixed with a few red lights near the middle.  These lights were all moving slowly together as though they were on the bottom of a very large moving object. The shape was elongated but it appeared to have wings on each side in the middle. The lights covered this base and wing surface area. I felt that I was looking up underneath the object.  It slowly and quietly moved in a straight line right above the trees across my backyard and my neighbors backyard.  It moved at the same speed until it disappeared.  I listenend for a helipcopter or plane noise but only noticed a low level hum as it disappeared in the distance. Then I heard a swhoosh noise.  The object was massive and it seemed as though it was deliberately scanning the area. Later I saw the two lights again bu!t this time they darted away.

19970722	19970722	 Susquehanna, PA	 circle	approx.8minutes	Summary : Large clear orangish circle shaped object.While burning papers in an enclosed burner, I looked up at my garage roof and thought I had set it afire.Then i realized that what I wa seeing was something hovering at the peak of the roof and it was orange clear object about what I would say would be the size of a Volkeswagon beetle. It appeared to be at roof level and then went higher in the air, clearing the house roof and continuing across the street . It had come from the northeast and went southwest. I had my neighbor come out and she saw it as it was much higher in the sky and about 6 other people down the street were watching it also, but it was high in the sky to them also. Shapewise, it appeared to be circular, clear orange and just floating above garage roof. We, the observers range in the 30-48 age with two being teenagers. Our local police officer was called after it had gone thru and he informed me that about two months ago he had seen an object that he could not explain.
19970722	19970722	 Tequesta, FL	 fireball	0:01:00	Summary : Saw object resembling firework flare streaking across sky.  First thought: shooting star but much too large for placement in sky.Saw very bright flare-shaped light in sky.  Very like flare from a firework.  Then, realized it was way too large for how far up in the sky it was to be any flare.  Then, thought it was like a shooting star.  Again, too intense, too colorful (yellow/orange) and did not have trajectory I have seen with real shooting stars.  It also stayed in the sky longer than shooting stars.  The flare shape elongated to almost a line, still quite colorful and bright, and it was covered by cloud formation.  When it emerged (15 seconds approx) later, it seemed to be a single light! Small! No sound (although I have no idea if sound could be heard because I don&apos;t know how to really estimate how far away it was).  Then, it rather slowly continued east and went behind another very thin formation of cloud coverage.  I never saw it again!  The sky was clear except for this very thin cloud formation.  I fully expected to be able to see it &quot;on the other side.&quot;
19970408	19970721	 Las Vegas, NV	 rectangle	15 sec	Summary : large, erratic, black object, movement reminiscent of paper falling, almost invisible edge on.Hmmmm- perhaps you can help clear up an incident that has been nagging at me.  I was attending the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas starting 4/5/97- I believe it was Tuesday the 8th, about 8pm, I looked out the window of the Flamingo Hilton and saw what looked to like a dark piece of paper caught in an updraft. It shifted erratically in a descending pattern and at times almost disappeared from view when it was &quot;on edge&quot;. As the object moved lower and it became framed by the backdrop of mountains I came to the conclusion that it was much farther away than I had initially thought and well outside of the city.  I tried to reassess the scale of the object, but found it difficult. At a guess I would say the object was 15 or more miles from the city and looked like a windblown piece of construction paper at 100 feet. The scale of horizontal and vertical shifts in trajectory also took on the appearance of a much greater distance and considerable implied ! speed. The object dissappeared from view perhaps 10-15 seconds after initial siting. Perhaps 2 or 3 minutes later 2 sets of dual vapor trails emmerged along the horizon and as they reached the point where the object appeared to have descended the planes (these were obviously planes and what looked to be military planes) forked out in opposite directions. I mentioned it to a couple of colleagues in the airport the next day on the return to Seattle, a woman in line overheard me and suggested that it could have been a Stealth aircraft. Could be- my impression was that if it was &quot;a plane &quot; it was only a piece of it- perhaps a wing. I am not convinced that I saw a &quot;flying saucer&quot;. But by any definition it was an unidentified flying/airborn object that evoked a military response. Do you have any other reports of objects seen or military maneuvers in that locality at that time?

19910705	19971117	 Detroit, OR	 light	30 sec	Summary : small flash, streak of light, light stopped, then went other way slowly.We (my family and I) were camping along Detroit Lake in Oregon over the 4th of July. On the night of the 5th, we were sitting around the campfire as usual. I have been interested in astronomy for all my life (16 years at that time) and was looking up at the night sky. Out there at the lake you can see a lot more than in the city. While looking up into the Eastern sky, I saw a flash of light about the size of the moon, but about as bright as a 1/4 moon. Instantly after the flash, what looked to be a shooting star came streaking out of the flash. It shot across the sky for about 1.5 seconds and stopped instantly. When it stopped, it was about as bright as an average star. After it stopped, it waited for about 1 second and began traveling back the way it came from, at about the speed of a satelite. Me and my famiily saw this, and we can not explain it. It wasn&apos;t a shooting star, because they don&apos;t stop and go back slowly. It wasn&apos;t a satelite because of the way it acted. And as for the flash, I have no idea. We were all sobor when we saw this.
19971114	19971114	 Snoqualmie, WA	 formation	2 MIN	We were heading west on the North Bend to Fall City Road. (203?) There were two parallel primary bright objects with multiple bright objects following, much like one would expect of a comet or a shooting fireworks display. The tails were reddish in color extending quite far behind and again moving parallel. Low on the horizon the tails were perhaps the width of my palm (4&quot;) at arms length. The tails seemed to get shorter as the objects moved toward us. The objects were moving very slow, about the speed of a plane about to land, from a West-Southwest to a East Northeast direction. It seemed to come over Tiger or Cougar Mountain and disappear just to the north of Mt. Si.  They started very low on the horizon and moved up and over my shoulder. I had the distinct impression that I was watching something burning up.  My comment was it looks like a sattelight breaking apart and burning up, but again it was very low on the horizon. The tail was reddish but gave the feel of a headlight piercing fog.  However the sky was exceptionally clear. Observer(s): Male 48, Female 45, two children 13 and 11. Both my wife and I have college degrees with post graduate work. However no navigational or flight experience. Hope it helps ((Name deleted))
19970313	19970319	 Prescott, AZ	 formation	10 min	Summary : Observed five yellow-white lights travelling from NW to NE then turning to SWhile doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a &quot;V&quot; formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight.  The point of the &quot;V&quot; was in the direction of movement. The first three lights were in a fairly tight &quot;V&quot; while two of the lights were further back along the lines of the &quot;V&quot;&apos;s legs. During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position.  I estimated the three ;ight &quot;V&quot; to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky.
19970723	19971005	 Warrenton, VA	 triangle	10 seconds	Summary : triangular metalic object high in the sky moving at an extreme high rate of speed.changed direction 3 times at sharp angles.Sighted a triangular object that I thought was a high flying aircraft going from north to south. It suddenly excellerated at avery high rate of speed for a couple of seconds and then stopped. It moved to the left at a high rate of speed an stopped. Then travelled back to the right at high speed across the sky,and stopped. Then started moving back to the left it just disappeared. Sky was clear,8:00 in the evening. If it&apos;s one of ours,boy what an aircraft.
19970430	19970506	 Westboro/Marlboro, MA	 other	15 minutes	Summary : Two friends of mine were driving back from a class last Wednesday when they spotted a strange object over a field.  At first they thought it was a light tower but then it moved.On the night of Wednesday, April 30, 1997 two co-workers were travelling back to Marlboro from a class.  They were travelling down Lyman St. in Westboro.  They had passed a hospital on the left that leads into a large cornfield.  Mary looked over first and noticed the strange object.  It looked just like a light tower with a vertical galvinized metal pole in the center and bright strobe-type lights on either side.  Mary was more curious than scared and she asked ((Name deleted)) what she thought it was.  ((Deleted)) dismissed it as a light tower but ((Name2 deleted)) insisted that it moved.  She slowed the car down and it was indeed moving.  ((Deleted)) started to get nervous and told ((Deleted)) to keep going.  It started to get closer to the car so they sped off.  When they got to the next intersection they looked ahead of them and the object was now across the street infront of them.  ((deleted)) was suppose to make a right to go home but decided to take a left and head towards the police station.  Once inside ((Deleted)) ex!plained to the dispatcher what they had just witnessed.  The dispatcher called out to a couple of cars in the area.  They hadn&apos;t reported seeing anything.  The police thought they had seen a cellular phone tower that had just gone up recently.  Mary tried to explain that &apos;towers don&apos;t move.&apos;  While they were at the police station, there was a man waiting to fill out a police report.  He overheard what my friends had to say and he thought it was strange.  He had been working late around the Lyman St. area and when he walked out to his car it was completely engulfed in flames.  He was the last one in his office and he said this happened around the same time of the sighting.  Could the two events be related?  An officer escorted both my friends out to where the new cellular phone tower was put up.  Both((Names deleted)) confirmed that it wasn&apos;t what they had seen.  The next day, ((Name deleted))drove back down Lyman St. to see if there was anything that might explain what she had seen but th!ere was nothing.  ((Name deleted)) and I drove by on Friday afternoon (5/2) and she said the same thing.  Since this day we have tried to find a picture or anything similiar to what they had seen.  I have only seen pictures of the classic saucer so far.Both ((Names deleted)) are the most sane and reliable people I know.  They are both professional business women.  ((Deleted)) is a true sceptic and has become somewhat obsessed with finding an answer to this.  She has asked me to do a search on U.F.O.&apos;s and that&apos;s how I&apos;ve gotten to your page.  I hope someone there might have some answers.Thanks,((Name deleted))

19651001	19970625	 Desert, NM	 disk	15 minutes	Summary : While traveling at night we saw what appeared to be a glowing dish in the distance about 600 yards away and 200 ft  high. The car lights dimmed and radio turned to static and our dog hid under the car seat during the event. I was just 10 at the time but have vivid memories of it. This is my first report of the incident.While traveling at night between two cities in New Mexico,  we saw what appeared to be a glowing dish in the distance about 600 yards away and 200 ft  high. The silver dish was about 100-200 ft across, and had brilliant red, orange, and blue lights coming from the bottom.  The car lights dimmed and radio turned to static and our dog hid under the car seat during the event while we passed the object. After passing it ( it remained stationary ) the lights came back up, and radio came back on.. I was just 10 at the time but have vivid memories of it. This is the first time I have &quot;officially&quot; reported the sighting.
19971122	19971122	 Petoskey, MI	 egg	6-8 seconds	Summary : Very large flouresent green/bright white egg shaped &quot;thing&quot; traveling extremely fast.I live in rural northern Michigan. I am a honest, no nonsense husband and father who was cleaning up outside the house before winter sets in. I happend to look up at just the right time to see a very large and very fast, floresent green object flying north. I only  observed it for a few seconds as it flew through a break in the clouds. I was shaking by the time I got back to the house to tell my wife. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The object was egg or tear dropped shaped. The green &quot;glow&quot; was surrounded by a bright white &quot;glow&quot;. Both the green and white trailed the object a short distance to form a short &quot;glowing&quot; tail. I was looking NW when I saw &quot;it&quot;.
19971128	19971202	 St. Paul, MN	 fireball	5 secs., max	Summary : An orange &quot;shooting star&quot; in the SSE area of the sky.This object was very orange. I&apos;d never seen an object this orange, and it fizzled, throwing off sparks as it fell. It ended with a visual &quot;poof.&quot;  It was like a pop-bottle rocket in reverse. I saw this driving home from work. I can easily believe it was just a piece of meteor or space junk that got unusually close to the earth to flame and spark so much. Most other shooting stars I&apos;ve seen have been white and made a thin white line as they&apos;ve streaked across the sky. This seemed to have a more downward motion to the earth. I wouldn&apos;t report it other than the fact that I heard Peter&apos;s report on the Art Bell show, and was wondering if the sighting in Chicago occurred at this time. I didn&apos;t catch the day or time of the sighting. If this seems to fit the description of a regular falling star, then I apologize for having taken your time. It&apos;s just that I&apos;d never seen a shooting star this orange. Thanks. BTW, I work as a copy editor at a daily newspaper here in the Twin Cities and am skeptical-to-open about UFOs, etc.

19970729	19970728	 North Delta Municipality, B.C. (Canada), BC	 unknown	05 Seconds	Summary : I&apos;m 14 years old, I came back from umpiring one night and decided to take a swim. Moments later, I looked up and there was a silvery object flying through the sky!I am a 14 year old male who is employed with the BC Baseball Umpiring Association of Canada. After I finished umpiring my two back-to-back games, I decided when I got home, that I would swim in my pool. So I changed in my bathing suit and headed toward my pool at 12:00 in the morning. The first thing I did was look up at the stars, basically because I am very interested in ufology, astronomy, chemistry and physics. I floated on my back in the water just staring up, looking for constallations that I could spot. All of a sudden, I hear a crackle by the fence, (which ran parallel to our neighbour&apos;s backyard). I found out pretty quickly that it was the rustling of leaves on the tree beside my house, over-hanging our pool. Then I turned around, and there was this object approaching me. It was moving in a south-easterly direction toward me. It couldn&apos;t have been a &quot;shooting star&quot; because shooting stars only travel about 3 to 4 feet when you look at it form Earth. And it couldn&apos;t have been a medeorite or a comet, because this bright glowing object didn&apos;t appear to have a tail. And it was moving too fast to be an aircraft manufactured by the likes of your current technology. It came out of the trees form nowhere, passed over my house and pool, and was gone in 5 sec! onds. I stood there dumbfounded. I can&apos;t explain any other detailed appearance, as I never caught a glimpse of the shape it was moving so fast. I was the only witness to this incredible phenomena.

19790301	19970725	 Medford, OR	 unknown	5 min	Summary : While in flight landing at Medford from Klammath Falls, I spoted what appeared to be another aircraft flying the opposite direction.  Since the moon was setting, when this craft siluetted againt the moon, I could see it had no tail.  I turned toward the craft, it turned toward me.  The encounter ended with the craft flying formation with me for about 30 seconds, where I could see much detail of two craft.This encounter may be too old to be of interest to you.  I did report it to a Universite the day after, but I do not remember which University.  I got the phone number from the Medford Police for the University.  About 4 years ago I reported the encounter to Dr. Haynes.  I only mention it to you now, because I still have relatives in Medford, who sent me a newspaper clipping of a recent sighting there, that mentions the name of your organization.  If you have an interest in more detail, let me know, I will email you a full description. Russ Smith

19970723	19970724	 Phoenix, AZ	 triangle	1 minute	Summary : July 23, 1997; 8:25 PM; Phoenix AZ/ 9822 N. 16th Place; Looking west, then north. Three witnesses at the same location as the March 13th sightings.  We saw a rounded triangle-shaped object totally black against the lighter sky. Within 300 feet. Object could have been 100 ft in diameter. There was a faint glow on each side of it.July 23, 1997; 8:25 PM; Phoenix AZ/ 9822 N. 16th Place; Looking west, then north. My background is that myself and my family saw the extraterrestrial craft of March 13, 1997 fly directly over our house.  Our family was featured in the USA Today article on June 18, 1997 and then on various TV programs. 	I had been sitting in my back yard with my son-in-law Danny Pasqualini and grandson Adrian.  We had been talking about the March 13th sighting and then the return of the craft on June 25th.  We were trying to understand where did the people on the craft come from?  I told them about a outline of a story I wrote in 1966 which could possibly explain where these people were from. I recounted the story of Windsloop, a man living at some time after the destruction of the world. At one point in the story he is &quot;captured&quot; by &quot;extraterrestrials&quot;.  Everyone thought the world had been devastated by the &quot;gods&quot; and the world was only now in its &quot;feudal&quot; stage.  There was no real science or technology nor people that could operate technology. We find out that right before the destruction, an armada of space ships left the earth with scientists and mechanics and technicians and scholars etc.  They knew destruction was coming and they wanted to preserve civilization.  They travelled for ove! r 100 years and arrived at an earth-like planet. They prospered and developed for 300 years and finally developed faster-than-light travel.  They immediately sent &quot;scout&quot; ships back to earth and found it devastated.  They built a huge ship, over 1 mile in diameter filled with everything they would need to &quot;resurrect&quot; the earth and its people. Windsloop ends up joining up with the &quot;returnees&quot; and agrees to be an &quot;agent for rebirth&quot; of the planet earth. Right after I finished the story and we stood up, and looked to the western sky, where the sun had gone down while we had been sitting there. Out of nowhere we saw an object moving through the sky west of us, perhaps 500 feet away and up about 200 feet. It was solid black and had a rounded triangular shape. The first thing we noticed was its absolute silence.  At first we thought it was a balloon, but after watching it for 10 seconds or so we knew it was not a balloon. Its movement was too deliberate and too rapid to be a balloon! .  It was moving diagonally from the southwest to the northeast directly in front of us and then passed us on the north side of my property heading slightly northeast until we lost it in the darker eastern sky. It almost seemed to fly out at 300 feet around the edge of my property first on the west side then on the north.  It made absolutely no sound at all at any time.  We had just seen a small plane come from the west towards us and we could here its engine from a couple of miles away. This thing passed within 300 feet of us as it passed by us on the north side of my yard. It&apos;s altitude over the area was only about 200 feet up but as it headed northeast it went higher. It was completely black against the dimly lit background sky and it seemed to have a slight glow on either side of it towards the rear.  The glow seemed to come from the other side of the object as if there was a light source of some kind on the other side of the object and it was &quot;bleeding&quot; over the edge so ! it could be seen just as an edge glow, slightly reddish and yellow on each side. From that view it seemed this object was facing its &quot;bottom&quot; away from us as it went around us. Its profile seemed almost spherical; but more oval at the leading end, so it almost seemed like a very rounded triangle with the point leading and the glow on both sides of the base end. We all were astonished because there was no earthly explanation for what we had just seen. Danny was saying &quot;what the heck is that?&quot;  I said &quot;What do you think it is? Its a flyover by one of those craft. What else could it be?&quot;  And we were even more astonished because we had just been talking about the visitors and where might they have come from.  For the three of us, it was not a coincidence that this UFO showed up at that moment.  It was a verification for us that there are people on these craft and they are deliberately letting us see them, and that they were here at God&apos;s behest to help mankind.
19970328	19970509	 Houston, TX	 sphere	2 MIN	Summary : SMALL GLOBE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A TENNIS BALL, ORANGE/GOLD IN COLOR.  SIGHTING WAS MADE AT NIGHT, WITH NAKED EYE.  OBJECT FLEW THROUGH THE TREE TO TOP OF THE HOUSE, HOVERED, CIRCLED ONCE AND FLEW AWAY.I was outside on the patio with the dog, talking to a friend on the phone.  From the corner of my eye, I spotted movement through the branches of the tree beside the garage, about twenty feet from me.  I turned to get a closer look.  There were no outside lights on, nor was there any light from the house spilling onto the paito or garage as none were on at the time.  As I turned, the object floated through the tree limbs to the top of the house visible from the patio.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then circled somewhat drunkenly as if determinig the direction to go.  It then flew over the house towards my neighbors house in a southwesterly direction. I was unable to track it futher as it was gone in an instant.  I described it to my friend as I watched it.The object was about the size of a tennis ball, perfectly round.  It had an orangey-gold glow, reminding me of the light a firefly gives off, but more yellow.  It was to large to be an insect.  I normally wear glasses for distance viewing, but did not have them on at that time, so the object was large enough for me to see without my glasses.  It was perfectly round.I am 47 years old, female and married.  At the time, I was home alone as my husband was in the hospital.  I have seen some things in the past that I could not explain, but never bothered to tell anyone for fear I&apos;d not be believed.  However, this was REALLY strange.  I have not been able to come up with any explaination.  The evening was clear, as I&apos;d seen the comet earlier and there were stars out.  There are not lights anywhere near where I saw this objcet.I do have a question that is not related to this:  Are there planes that fly low, rather large with bright lights that DO NOT MAKE A NOISE?  I have seen several over the past five months.  As we live near a large airport, I wondered if what I&apos;ve been seeing is a plane or planes?  It&apos;s usually late at night, after midnight when I see these.  They are not the planet Venus, unless the plantet likes to fly very low over our neighborhood.  I repeat, there is absolutely NO sound before or after this plane or whatever, flies overhead.  It&apos;s the bright lights that get your attention.I would prefer your not contacting me as it would upset my husband who is not in good health.  Thank you.
19971001	19971004	 Fort Jennings, OH	 other	2 minutes	Summary : I saw an object moving from north to south which appeared to have red and orange revolving lights around it.  The craft was absolutely silent, and by judging distance, appeared to be moving at a good rate of speed.What I saw was what started out as a red dot in the sky.  As it moved closer from the north, I began to see what appeared to be red and orange revolving lights.  The object appeared to be no more than 1000 ft. from the ground hovering absolutely silent.  Though I cannot give an exact shape of the object, it did not appear to be saucer shaped.  It seemed to be more boxy or triangular shaped.  I watched the object for about 1 to 2 minutes until, well frankly, I became scared shitless.  I ran into the house to wake my mother so she could see the object, but by the time we got outside it had gone.  I said nothing about this to anyone outside of my family until Thursday night at work.  When I did talk about it at work, expecting to get laughed at, I found an older man who claims to have seen an object similar in description.  He saw it on his way home from work on the same night between 11:00 and 11:30 pm.  His sighting was about 10 miles WSW of mine, though he watched for about ! 20 minutes.

19660720	19970713	 Chosica (Peru),	 cylinder	1 minute	Summary : watched a cylindrical, clearly metallic, resembling shiny aluminum, somewhat rounded object hovering on nearby hills, moving pendulum-like in and out of sight over top of the hill, at about 2000 feet at most.  It suddenly dissapeared with a very fast vertical movement. no sound heard.About one or two in the evening, in broad daylight, no clouds, object was seen hovering nearby mountains, not above but in front and then behind of the top, particularly strange movements, pendulum-like, fast and then slow.  Cylindrical shape, clearly metallical and shiny like polished aluminum, no lights, perceived some rounded form in the middle, perhaps ring shapes on the top and bottom, probably sizable object of about 20 ft. long and 6 ft. wide.  No balloon, aircraft or any other object in the sky.  Was observed on rural area of Peru.  Object clearly seen in front of mountain background, no sound heard.  Object aparently disappeared but witnesses perceived very fast movement upward, in a northern direction. Event happened when I was about 12 or 13 years old, in 1966 or 1967, maybe thirty years ago. I just want to know if this kind of object or similar sighting exists in your archives or database.  It not only was  real, is a vivid image that for 30 years I been wondering about. I don&apos;t want explanations, I am not an ufo believer, but I have seen what I have seen, nobody believes it really, but for me this is not a matter of faith, is just something I saw as a boy and can&apos;t find no explanation for it. Please let me know about it, specially this rather strange object, diffrerent from the classic ufo&apos;s that everybody knows.
19971010	19971010	 Austin, MN	 other	1-hour	i was traveling northbound on state highway 105 approximately 8 miles south of Austin MN when an object came down directly above my car it scared the living daylights out of me. I drove off the road cause i couldnt see in front of me whe i came to a stop the object was still there.i cant say what it looked like because it was so bright i couldnt look directly at it it was dead silent didnt make a sound nor did it move i would say it stayed there for a good half ho ur or so then it shot straight up  anyways im sure it did because if it took off at an angle i would have gotten a good look at it

19970314	19970328	 Tonopah, AZ	 sphere	25 minutes	Summary : I-10 W of Tonapah AZ and Highway 85 S I watched3  golf ball sized lights &quot;QQQ&quot; being observed by ajet (half the size of a tack head) 20:25 lightsshut off and object disappeared, jet headed S towards BarryGoldwater USAF base, without any noise.March 14, 1997 I took Highway 95 south to I-10. That decision led to the most thought provoking and unexplainable incident ive ever encountered in the night sky.  I-10 just west of Tonapah AZI noticed an unusually bright, white light directly ahead.  I wondered what it was. It was brighter than the stars, and too high for a tower light, no skyscrapers in this area, mentally I eliminated what it wasn&apos;t.  Ithought I was moving towards the object, but in fact it was moving towards me.  Maybe it was the Hale-Boppcomet, but no traveling light.  I thought I would soon discover the origin of the slowly growing white light.I had been watching the object for a good 10 minutes.  Im not sure whether I blinked and missed something orthe object just moved up very fast.  I could see that the bright white light was a cluster of 3 lights.  Itmoved to the far left as if circling and moved out in front but below the cluster object.  I assumed thiswas something examining the larger object, possibly an USAF jet.  My mind curiously questioned,if the smallerobject is a jet what in the world could the big thing be?  The smaller craft (size of a tack)  stayed out frontfor a while.  Then it moved around to the right.  I assumed it was making a full circle check of the light clusterwhich appeared to be the size of three lined up golf balls, intensly bright lights.  The smaller craft was a fewinches in the night sky, to the right and due south of the cluster when the lights turned off.  I watched the smallcraft make a wide ark turn to the right.  It headed south towards Mexico,towards Barry Goldwater USAF base. I checkedmy watch 8:25pm I watched for a good 20 minutes.  Not until the lights abruptly shut off had I allowed myself to thinkof this as a UFO mystery. Where was the noise?  Then the reality hit me, I had seen the stealth bomber a dozen timesand its baby bird next to this
19970115	19970417	 Long Beach, NY	 egg	5 mins	Summary : A bright luminesant egg shaped object aproached the beach from the south and hovered with out sound for three mins.After a brief walk along the beach my wife and I observed what we at first thought was a far off air craft. In an instant it came upon us. Hovering aproximately 100 yards from shore came an object about 50ft round, like a football, or an egg. No moving parts or visible interuptions were seen. It was almost like a light bulb . It stood motionless and made no sound. Right about the time that wee all started yelling for attention it flew away back the way it came. I did not report this to any officials knowing that I would get nothing more that some B-S story.

19970301	19970622	 Riverside, CA	 triangle	15 seconds	Summary : The reports of various UFO events over the Arizona sky on March 13 ofthis year has prompted me to reveal the experience my wife and I had inthat time frame although I am not sure of the exact date.The night we were outside was a perfectly clear night over the InlandEmpire of the Los Angeles Metro Area.  We live across the Santa AnaRiver in unincorporated Riverside in an area commonly known as IndianHills.  My wife and I were enjoying a night in our hot tub around 8:30to 9:00 PM and looking up at the evening sky which for our area,although obscured somewhat by city lights, was very good for stargazing. I remember we did not have the jets or pumps on at the time soit was very quiet also.  My wife was looking to the southwestern sky andI was looking to the northwestern sky at the time. All the sudden, atalmost a ten o&apos;clock position, I could see a black but translucent likeobject moving through the sky west to east at a tremendous rate ofspeed. This object seemed to pulsate as it moved. However, it did nothaving any lights or normal jet aircraft type blinkers on it. It wasV-shaped at the front however I could not make anything out at the tailend of the object (whether it was flat, circular or angular).  There wasno noise at all associated with the sighting or any heat exhaust comingout from the rear of the object. Completely silent.By the time I alerted my wife to look towards the object it was in the12 o&apos;clock position almost straight above us.  Maybe 3 seconds hadpassed at the most from the time I spotted it till I spoke to my wife&quot;Holy cow honey look at this.&quot;  Obviously she could not see what I wasseeing right away.  I just grabbed her head and put her line of sightover my arm towards the object almost like a gun barrel.  Finally shecould see it at around the the 1 o&apos;clock position. We followed it forabout another 5 to 10 seconds. At the final moment little sparkles seemto come off of it and then it disappeared. We were stunned.  Almostspeechless.The reports of various UFO events over the Arizona sky on March 13 ofthis year has prompted me to reveal the experience my wife and I had inthat time frame although I am not sure of the exact date.The night we were outside was a perfectly clear night over the InlandEmpire of the Los Angeles Metro Area.

Almostspeechless.I remember holding my thumb against the sky to see if I could size theobject. My thumb could obsure it but not completely cover it. It wasvery high in the sky but I could not tell exactly how high. We are closeto Ontario Airport but this was not a jet aircraft that I know of.Normally aircraft that we see and hear coming and going from our areaare moving at a rate of speed that you can watch for almost a minute ata time. This thing moved in a matter of seconds from the far west to fareast.  And it pulsated. Not in steady patterns either. Almost quick andjerky at times.  Not like the steady movement like a jet aircraft.How do I know? First of all, I have a good knowledge base aboutaircraft. I have logged over a million air miles in my occupation overthe last 14 years.  I am very good at spotting 727&apos;s to 747&apos;s or DC-9&apos;sto DC-10&apos;s.  I know commercial aircraft. Was this one? No way. Secondly,I also lived near Offut Air Force base in the 70&apos;s and frequently takemy kids to airshows at several airforce bases.  I know how normalmilitary aircraft move through the sky. Was this one? Nothing that Iknow of.My background. I am a sales manager for Fortune 125 company that hasmultiple divisions. Many which supply sophisticated electronic equipmentto the military.  I have an educational background in computers andelectronic journalism. I once installed the equipment that I now sell.I am more like a sales engineer. My daily routine is technical anddetailed.  My reputation involves making reliable and sound informativedecisions, statements, and judgements.Obviously, I am somewhat skeptical.  I have tried to rationalize in mymind what I saw that night.  Maybe that&apos;s what has taken me so long torelay this to you.  The reports in Arizona have finally prompted me totell our story.  I have no video. No pictures. No other evidence.  Onlytwo eyewitnesses that I know of.  My wife and I. But we saw it. Now Ialways look to the night sky differently.
19970415	19970513	 Coolidge/Casa Grande (between), AZ	 light	10 minutes	Summary : On different nights in April a co-worker and I were on our way home from work. I saw some lights in the sky and he thought they were lights on signal peak. I pointed out that they were very huge and yellow colored. They almost looked like the flares that the military shoot off for their night drills.They showed no movement, there was no smoke trailing from them, and the ground did not appear to be lit up from them. WE kept watch up until we got in to town. Sometimes we could see them from his house on the edge of town. Other times they would be gone. Occasionally one light would fade away or the object turned. Unsure if all lights were on one object or were actually three objects. We were watching them before they were on the news. The lights mostly just seemed to hover. Did not observe them leaving the area, so unsure as to the capability of speed or manuvers. Have seen many objects in the past make very fast sharp turns that known aircraft are not supposed to make. This pa!rticular sighting, the object  seemed to be either in a wedge formation or triangular shaped.From five miles out of town the lights appeared larger than than the street lights we could see in town.Once in town they appeared to be as big as a basketball.My co-worker and I both work for the Dept. of ((Name deleted)).

19970617	19970618	 Beaumont (campsite, near Fulton), MO	 light	10 min	Summary : Looking notheast towards Vega 3 pinpoints of light flew in formation towards Vega. 3 more flew up from below towards Vega they then formed a circle and spun in a counterclockwise motion, felw towards the center, formed a bright flash and then blinked out.The points of light appeared white the final bright light was white. This was qutite a distance away, I judged them in comparison to a passing high flying commercial aircraft.
19970312	19970401	 Glendale (SSW of), AZ	 light	over 3 weeks	Summary : Stationary object SW of the Phoenix AZ area seen over several nights. Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix.Over about a two week period I noticed a single light in the sky at about the area of the estrella mountains south west of Phoenix. I thought it odd because I am not aware of any roads or power lines in the Estrella mountains. The light was a yellow light similar in appearance to a low power sodium vapor street light. Observed at about the same angle that the peak of the highest peak of the Estrella mountains would be from my observation point. (I had concluded that because it did not move that somehow someone had installed a street light on top of the Estrella Mtns). I did notice that it would occaisionaly fade out and later reappear in the same spot. This light was last observed on Mar 12 the day before the mutiple lights observed across Arizona. The yellow light description of the multiple lights reminded me of what I had been observing, so I double checked the angles from various reference points where I had observed the light and consistently found that that the locatio!n where I had rembered the light being was further west than where the mountains are located. This would place the light in open sky rather than on one of the peaks.I did observe this light on several different nights at various locations several miles apart. The object&apos;s aparent location was consistantly in the same area which would place it approximatly 20 miles south of Luke Air Force Base or about 20 miles ssw of downtown Glendale at an altitude of about 1000 ft (comparable to the nearby mountain peaks).Despite looking for it, this light has not re-appeared since the major event of lights here in AZ
19970812	19970817	 North Lynnwood, WA	 light	about 10 sec.	Summary: four spots of light in a pointing config. moved E. to W. without fading.  Lights didn&apos;t seem &quot;twinkling&quot; or shooting-star like.  Didn&apos;t look like searchlights-too far up.  During the Perseid Meteor Showers.  Seemed like they didn&apos;t fit in up there!I went out that very early morning to specifically watch the star showers.  Living  in an apartment complex, there was a mostly dark area away from the lights where I laid out on the grass with my blanket around me; my head towards the south and my feet towards the north.  In this position on my back, it was dark enough to provide a spectacular view.  I had gone outside about 12:15-ish a.m. 8-12-97, so this is how I guess-timated the time of this event at about 12:30a.m.  Before the event happened, I watched the usual stuff, and the meteors were coming at about 2 or 3 a minute.  Then, suddenly an unusual configuration of four spots of light, with three on one side and one on the other side, (like it was pointing) start in the east (it just appeared out of nowhere) and moved somewhat smoothly and quickly to the west; straight across without fading!  It (the configuration) didn&apos;t look like it belonged up there; it seemed so out of place!  1.)  They certainly didn&apos;t look like a! group of searchlights.  They were too high up.  2.)  They didn&apos;t have the appearance of &quot;twinkling&quot; or comet-like (no tails).  3.)  The light spots were white and slightly blurred on the edges, but anyone watching wouldn&apos;t be able to miss what I saw.  These spots were in a definite arrangement or pattern, and I didn&apos;t see nor hear any plane or other recognizable shape that would tell me otherwise what this thing was.  It was an event of some sort that made me sit up, take notice and start thinking, as never in my life did I ever see anything like I saw that night.  I had actually sat up to say aloud to myself, &quot;What in the world was that?&quot;  The configuration was definitely moving (purposefully so) east to west.
19970831	19971007	 West Dennis (Cape Cod), MA	 oval	&lt; 1 minutes	Summary : Three &quot;oval-shaped&quot; objects, in formation: one in front, one directly behind, one &quot;above&quot; and behind the second one.  All three appeard fuzzy or out of focus.  They appeared to be moving at the same speed as the satellites we had been observing.My wife, a female friend, and I were looking for satellites.  We were facing west, and it was a clear night.  We watched three or four satellites pass almost directly over-head, when my wife&apos;s friend said she&apos;d spotted another satellite. I raised my binoculars and noticed not one but thee oblong or oval objecs, each appearing &quot;blured&quot; or out of focus  All three were in formation, one directly behind the leader, the third &quot;above&quot; and a bit behind the second one. As the three objects moved together across the stars behind them, I could see stars &quot;beween&quot; the objects, indicating it was in fact three objects and not one. The objects appeared to be moving at approximately the same rate as a passing satellite.  The objects were in view for approximately 30-40 seconds, then they passed behind some high, thin cirrus clouds and we lost sight of them. All thre of  us saw the objects, and all three described the same thing.

19951118	19970717	 Ringgold, GA	 delta	15 min.	Summary : On Saturday evening just after dark on November 18, 1995 an arrowhead-shaped ufo was spotted to the east approx. 100 yrds. from Davis Ridge Road hoovering just above tree top level, shinning a beam downward behind the neighbors home. It was motionless and totally silent. It had a light at each corner and the beam came from the center. It was approx. 40&apos; x 25&apos;. After I got out it started moving west at about 5 mph. We followed until it descended behind a ridge out of sight about a half mile away. The neighbors had cattle out back. -((deleted)) AdministratorI also work as the founder and administrator of ((deleted)) , a satellite and high altitude survey and mapping oriented organization that provides information about new technology for discovering natural resources and minerals, surveying, guides, and related issues  ((URL deleted)) . I&apos;ll take any test to prove the validity of my observation. My family is highly respected in the community as honest and truthful. On one Saturday evening just after dark  The black, arrowhead-shaped ufo was hoovering silently as it casted a cone-shaped beam into the neighbors back yard. We couldn&apos;t see what it was shinning on as it was behind the crest of the high-ground behind the house where the cattle were kept. I got out of the car which was stopped in the middle of the road and looked over the roof at the ufo in astonishment. It was completely silent. It had a light at each corner underneath and the beam came from the bottom center of the craft. Apparently, we were spotted too, and the ufo turned the beam off. Then it proceed at a low speed (approx. 5 mph) to the west. We were observing the ufo eastward from Davis Ridge Road at first. It came almost directly over us. It was about 80&apos; off of the ground. It continued west and we turned the car around and followed. The road ran north and south though, and b! y the time we were heading west coming off the ridge we saw it descend below a ridge to the west of us. We saw it no more. The whole affair lasted about 15 minutes. Everyone in the car saw it. We all had gotten out to see it before we jumped back in to pursue it. I got the impression that the occupants of the craft could care less if we saw it that night, as it seemed to be in no hurry for the most part.
19971106	19971118	 Kentwood, MI	 other	1 minute	Summary : Large, oval object with 2 small flashing red lights and 2 large steady white lights, 150 to 200 feet in air above a barn right next to Wing St. Object was hovering perfectly still.I was driving down Wing St. just after sundown and saw in the distance 2 small flashing red lights with 2 larger white lights above the red lights. The white lights were spaced farther apart than the red lights. As I got closer, I saw that the object was perfectly still. The white light beams shone straight ahead into low clouds. The object appeared to be about 150-200 feet in the air (very LOW). It hovered above a barn in a borderline suburban/rural area. The shell seemed to be made of metal, riveted together (very industrial- looking, Star Wars-like). I did not stop my car but drove to my destination about 3 minutes (1 mile ) from the site. When I got out of my car, the lights were not visible across a field.
19970704	19970708	 Old Valmeyer Bottoms-Valmeyer, IL	 teardrop	30seconds	Summary : Blue bullet shaped light appeared 200-400ft above ground level.  Traveling slightly slower than a meterorite, and lasting approx. 30 seconds, then simply fading.  The object was traveling in a East to West direction.12 people noticed the object, as we were watching a fifeworks display ( about 2-3 miles away.)  The object simple appeared in the sky, and was traveling from the Illinois bluffs towards St. Louis, Roughly E to W. All people noticed the object, half saying it was a meterorite, the others saying it was part of a fire work that had strayed. Niether of these two theories would work because 1) the object was very low as compared to other meterorites we had seen, and 1) we set up about 2-3 miles from the fireworks display therefore no stray objects could have traveled that distance.
19960810	19970408	 George (The Gorge Amphatheatre), WA	 formation	1 minute	Summary : Three soft dim lights passing over head at a fast rate of speed in a vee formation.It was during a Sting concert in an outdoor amphatheater in Eastern Washington that I noticed three very dim lights appear in the sky flying in unison.  I was listening to the music and watching the sky looking for shooting stars (we didn&apos;t have great seats, but the music was great) when I noticed the lights.  I pointed them out to my girlfriend who was also looking for shooting stars.  At first I thought it was light reflecting off of low flying birds since they were moving so fast.  But they stayed in such perfect formation I quickly discounted that.  I came to the conclusion that it was a high flying military plane (no sound, so I assumed military) that was reflecting in the lights of the concert.  Then tonight I heard on the news of a similar report in Pasco, WA (near George) and thought maybe I should report it.
19971120	19971121	 Frostbite Falls, MO	 disk	06:13	Summary : Saw UFO, my friends saw it to.I was taking a shower when I saw a bright light and a loud noise.

19971001	19971014	 Martinsville, VA	 other	5 mins	Summary : Yellow/Orange lighted object moving from NE to SW. Very bright toy top shape with no sound. About the size of a penny held at arm reach.Inverted triangle shape bright orange/yellow in color. Spotted low in the NNW sky as it moved in a SW direction. I am 50 years old, a Vietnam Marine Vet,and I have been employed at a local community college for the past 20 years,as a Audio Visual Manager. I have never seen anything like this befor. I would very much like to know what it was. Although I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t a airplane or any type of aircraft I&apos;ve seen before.
19970629	19970705	 Cave Creek, AZ	 triangle	15 minutes	Summary : One object, triangular (V-shaped) with 3 yellow lights, one at center of the V and one on each side at the end, with red lights at each side in between center yellow light and each side lightOn Sunday evening, June 29, 1997, my husband and I were getting ready to go to bed.  It was approximately 10:09 p.m.  Suddenly all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking and my husband went outside to see what all the commotion was about.  He ran back in the house yelling for me to come and look.  I went out on our front porch and looked up into the sky to where my husband was pointing.  There was an object in the sky to the north, it was heading south.  At first I thought, so what, there&apos;s an airplane in the sky.  Then the object stopped and hovered in one place, it then slowly began to move back and forth, from north to south, then south to north, north to south, south to north, for about 8 or 9 minutes.  Suddenly the object shot straight up into sky then stopped and hovered. At this point I began to get the chills.  Suddenly three rays of white light shot out from this object in a downward direction.  The object continued to hover for another minute or so, then the !beams disappeared and the object began to move back and forth again (north, south, north, south).  The object then came directly toward us, heading south, and flew over us.  Until it was directly over us  there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  When it was directly over us, you could hear an engine-type noise.  When it was directly over us, it appeared to be an airplane, but I have never seen an airplane move the way this object moved.  Nor have the dogs in my neighborhood ever barked at an airplane.  It was bizarre.  What the heck was it?  I don&apos;t know how far away it was.  I would say it definitely was not as far away as the stars or anything, guessing I would say maybe about 1500-2000 feet in the air.We live in a semi-rural desert area.  My husband and I are in our early 40&apos;s.  I have been a paralegal for 15 years, he trains horses.If you wish to contact me please use my Email address.  I would very much like to know what I saw.  I don&apos;t know much about  the latest in military airplanes and all that, and if the military is capable of making airplanes that can move like this, I sure would like to know.  On the other hand, if this was a UFO I would like to know that too.  Thanks!
19970208	19970727	 Stacy, MN	 unknown	1 to 2 min.	Summary : We observed something strange along the freeway with at least 5 strobe lights we thought it was going to crash, but it pulled up at the last second.My wife and I were heading home from Duluth Minnesota, south on interstate 35 on Feb. 8th 1997 at dusk, the sun was setting but there was still some light. About 2 miles north of Stacy Minnesota (North of Wyoming Minnesota) My wife said, look it&apos;s going to crash ! I looked out side window of the truck, and seen this .... I don&apos;t know what it was, it had 5 or more strobe lights lighting up one at a time around the perimeter of the object. I coundn&apos;t make out the shape because it was dusk, but I could see something. The &quot;craft&quot; came towards the ground at a steep angle and pulled up at the last second and went up..up..up. We watched for what seemed to be about a minute, I never did stop or pull off the freeway, I was just so amazed I didn&apos;t think of stopping ! The freeway runs parallel with state highway 61, the two roads are about 1/4 mile apart where we seen it, so it must have been about half way between interstate 35 and state hwy 61, about 1/8 mile from our truck. The freeway had alot of traffic, some one else had to see this, who would be playing in plane at this time of the evening, in the winter ? I thought plane only had one or two lights? I am only reporting this now because I have just learned about you and I am a big ufo secptic, but I also learned about a week later my in-laws, who winter in Phenoix, seen something really strang in march, which made the news. So I wanted to know if anyone else had seen what we seen ?

19971130	19971205	 Cardinal (Canada), ON	 cone	7 min&apos;s	Summary : My wife and I were just on our way to bed when I noticed this Bright light to the back of our property. At a distance of about 1 mile away and at least about 300-400 feet above the treetop line, just true north of our house this object was slowly moving on an westerly direction. It resembled an upside down funnel, rounded on the edges and the top of the funnel was rounded also. Looking at this it had 3 eggshaped oblisques attached to the bottom of the cone evenly spaced apart and rotating at different intervals. As they rotated they went from a bright yellow to a sharp orange. The main vessel consistently stayed at a bright yellow. My wife who also observed this, very quickly layed back down in bed and quite frankly told me that she did not want to talk about this at all. Our vision is good and this was no plane or helicopter or weather balloon.
19970704	19970704	 Redding (northeast of, out over Millville, approximately), CA	 light	approximately 5 minutes	Summary : Two amber lights moving at the same distance apart beginning at one end of Redding and ending in the north eastern direction above Redding.  The lights dropped another WAY brighter light that was white to the ground.  Then the most awesome part was that they just disappeared.  My husband, self and six year old daughter witnessed this.While driving East on Lake Blvd. in Redding, my husband pointed out a set of two lights that were not normal in formation nor in appearance for an airplane.  They were, from where we stood, approximately a quarter of an inch big each, amber in color, moving slowly north by north east?  When we pulled over to the side of the road after the first minute or so we realized they were not airplanes nor were they any other conventional type of air vehicle.  These were two lights going next to each other, approximately two inches apart, in unison as if hooked at the middle.  We could not differentiate if they were indeed hooked or not, but if hooked together by something this object would have to have been huge.  While sitting there freaking out at these lights, seeing them not blinking, or anything else, moving slowly, they headed north.  After a period of approximately 3-5 minutes, the further away of the two lights moved upward and dropped a giant white light from its bottom an!d this light was five times the size of each of the orange lights and dropped to the ground completely.  It was a huge white light that was so bright that it hurt our eyes.  The two other amber lights, still virtually in unison went out at that point and one popped sort of red for a second as they went out then disappeared completely.We are awestricken!  It seems that even though we stood near our car atop a big city hill gaping and screaming it&apos;s a ufo that nobody else stopped, however, someone had to have seen these...they were too obvious.

19970508	19970508	 Auburn, WA	 triangle	1 minute	Summary : we saw a &quot;V&quot; shaped object from beneath.  It had at least 15 lights .  no sound, it was traveling north bound right in the air traffic area of Sea-Tac planes. Trees obstructed our view, by the time we could see it again, it was gone.

19960223	19970401	 Los Angeles, CA	 triangle	1-2 minutes	Summary : At 20:15 Pacific time on 2/23/96, while out on balcony with telescope, looked west, south west,and saw 3 triangular shaped objects with an pale orangish color. No lights. No sound.While out with telecsope on 2/23/96, looking at Orion nebula, I glanced up from the eye peice, and towards the west, south west, saw 3 triangular objects.They were a pale orangish color, coming east, north east, from the Santa Monicaarea. They made no sound, and moved fairly fast. Stayed in tight formation, one at point, two trailing. No visible detail.I thought it might be fighter planes, like a Stealth fighter, since president Clinton was in Santa Monica that night, but there was no sound. I thought perhaps the color was due to sun reflecting off the craft,but the Stealth are black, not bare aluminium, and no sun reflects at 20:15 in February.

19880225	19970803	 Brandon, FL	 light	5mins	Summary : One evening I looked 100&apos; ahead and 100&apos; high and saw what looked like stadium lights in a vacant field where there was no lighting whatsoever.At apporox. the above date and time I was sitting in my car in front of my girlfriends house.  We were arguing and she was sitting in the front passenger seat yelling at me.  I looked out my front windshield and approx. 100&apos; ahead of me and 100&apos; high I saw what appeared to be &apos;3&apos; rows of stadium type lighting.  The lights were all white, but not bright enough that you couldn&apos;t look at it.  At first glance I thought nothing of it.  I blew it off as stadium lighting or some kind of neighborhood lighting.  I then turned back to listen to what my girlfriend was saying.  Suddenly, it hit me...There is no lighting in that area.  The only thing in that area is a vacant field. (approx. 1 square acre). So I quickly turned my head back toward the lights and said, &quot;What is that!?&quot;.  Before my girlfriend could turn her head to observe it, the lights disappeared.  It was as if someone turned off the light switch.  I was frozen with disbelief.  I didn&apos;t say anything or take my eyes off of! the spot.  I didn&apos;t even say another word.  My girlfriend kept asking me &quot;what?&quot;, &quot;What was it?&quot;, &quot;Talk to me you&apos;re scaring me.&quot;. I didn&apos;t talk. I just slowly got out of my car, walked directly to the spot where I had seen the lights and looked up.  NOTHING was there I MEAN NOTHING! I was standing directly below where I had seen the lights and nothing was around me...no poles...no lights...nothing. I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I had seen and she blew it off as some sort of stress related hallucination....However, a couple of nights later we were in her driveway and I was giving her a hug.  I had my back to the &quot;SITE AREA&quot; and she was facing it.  Suddenly she says, &quot;Did it look like that!?&quot;.  I turned quickly, but just as the last time it was gone.  Before I could turn my head.  She reacted the same way I did.  She was frozen and couldn&apos;t speak.  She walked over to the same spot as I did and looked up in awe. She said, &quot;I saw it.&quot; &quot;I saw what you told me about the o! ther day and just when I asked you about it, it disappeared as if someone had flipped the light switch.&quot;........What did we see??  Was it listening to us??  Was it trying to monitor our behavior?? For years I have been telling people about what I had seen.  To this day, noone has been able to explain it.  This is the first time I have gone public with this.  I am extremely credible and didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s until that night. I was a Tampa Police Officer for 2 years and  Tampa Police Dispatcher for 4 years.  In fact I was a Police Dispatcher at the time of my sighting.  My girlfriend and I are no longer together,  but she was a Deputy Sheriff and is currently a detective for a local security company.  Has anyone else ever heard of this type of UFO?  Can anyone ease my conscience?

19980422	19980513	 Federal Way (3 miles north of), WA	 light	3 seconds	Going north on I-5 about  3 miles past federal way  Seen a green light traveling west to about north west until it disappeared behind the tree topsFIRST I&apos;M GOING TO LET YOU KNOW I SAW THIS SAME EVENT ONE WEEK LATER ON 4/29/98 Between 9:20 and 9:30 pm. This is why I felt the need to report it. Heading north on I-5 both times around 9:30pm saw a green light off to my left  It was in view for about 3 seconds until the tree tops blocked my  view.  It had a tail but I dont&apos;t remember what color it was.  It was traveling west to about north west.  Cannot give a speed but it was traveling fast and stayed in the direction it was heading.  The shape of the object was round.  The second event was about the same but I saw it when I was going down the hill on I-5 north towards south center but the object was heading west not changing direction. I have lived in Tacoma washington all my life.  I&apos;m 29 yrs. old.  I graduated from Stadium High School.  Worked in monument business for 7 years.  Then went to work for Vitamilk dairy in north seattle.  member of the Teamsters local 66.
19980925	19980925	 Sunrise Beach, TX	 disk	20-30 sec	ufo and alien sightingI run a paper route in Texas on thur night fri morning I rounded a corner in Sunrisebeach Texas I saw a disk shaped craft with green and orange lights hoverung about 25 or 30 feet above the ground. When I first sighted the object there was a figure about4 foot 8 inches tall I was only able to see it ror about 2 seconds and it dissapered from my sight. Ther truck started to slow as it did there was a bright flash the brightest light I have ever seen I could not see in the dark for a few seconds when my sight focused the craft was gone.
19980412	19980518	 Whitefish, MT	 unknown	90 minutes	Saw bright &quot;star&quot; that changed into red, white, and blue lights.  Emitted a beam of light in a horizontal sweep of the sky.  Darted horizontally, vertically, and diagonally across the sky.I was out looking at the beautiful Montana sky one clear night, when my eyes caught an unusually bright star.  I thought nothing of it, but when I turned to look at the same spot again, the &quot;star&quot; had moved.  Then I looked at it from the corner of my eye.  It started to move again, but as soon as my eyes focused on it straight on, it stopped, like it had never moved. I stared directly at it, and less than five minutes later, it started to shake.  Then it darted across the sky, where it stayed for a few seconds more, then took of in another direction.  All together I watched this &quot;star&quot; for over an hour and half.  It had no regular flight path, and stopped, accelerated, and turned much too quickly and precise for any conventional aircraft. The longer I watched this, the more I began to notice.  It would change from a bright yellowish-white light to red, white, and blue lights.  It would also dart across the sky, change direction, and emit a faint white beam horizontally, in a 360 degree sweep of the night sky. Sometimes the light would get brighter, then slowly fade out and disappear, only to reappear in the same spot a few minutes later, like it had never moved.  Just last week, on May 12, I was standing on the top of Big Mountain, a ski resort here in Whitefish, and witnessed the same thing again.
19950611	19980224	 Guelpph (approx 6 km west of) (Canada), ON	 fireball	correction 20secs	Have been told could be ball lightining, I checked definition definitely not.  It was a red ball type of  light,  aproximately 3 times flashed off. Travelling at a very high speed approximately 6 fist lenghts off horizon, quite high.  It did a triangle flight pattern and proceeded to the north west  of sky area, did three sort of circular small patterns and went into atmoshpere,    It was a clear sky, was admiring stars for about 10 minutes prior.  Today is Feb 24, 1998 and I can still remember it clearly.  I was quite taken aback!!!  did some calling around to planetarium and observatories and they did not take me seriously, some said could be ball lighning.  What surpised me most was how quickly it would change direction.  Zooming from one end and quickly shifting flight direction.  I screamed for my friends to come out of the house but time did not permitt.  Their is a small single engine plane  airport in area somewhere but I could not understand what flight pattern I was seeing especially as it flew up into atmosphere. It did not disappear into distance ( i.e.east or west) but in altitude. Seem to originally come overhead of Kitchner to south east over to Cambridge then to Waterloo direction back to cambridge over toward Kitchner direction   then in Kitchener area its 3 spins  small circles like spirals and then shoots strainght out into atmoshpere (space)..  I mention the towns to give you indication of how I observed it in  its flight pattern
19980214	19980215	 Glen Burnie, MD	 oval	2-5 min.	I observed a light that I thought was a airplane. As I followed it for a few minutes I looked away few 1 second max. .And when I looked back where the object was it was no longer visible. At first I thought I lost it behind a tree that was obstructing my view. But Iwaited and the object never came back into view even when I moved to different viewpoints . It was very clear that night and I looked all around and there wasnt a    plane in sight. The object had dissappeared without a trace.I went outside to walk my dog when I spotted the light. It was about the size of half a penny held at arms length. It was yellowish-orangish in color. It made no sound or smell. It was moving at about the same speed a commercial airplane does. I spotted it in the southeastern sky and it was moving in a southwesternly direction. It was visible for about 2-5 minutes before it vanished. It was a very clear sky that night about as clear as it gets around here. I think its altitude was about 100ft to 200ft. It was oval or almond shaped. I thought it was a airplane until it dissappeared. This is my third sighting all in Southgate comunity in Glen Burnie MD.. My mother witnessed the second sighting (two craft). This sighting was only seen by myself.
19650601	19980121	 San Lorenzo, CA	 light	5-10 min	Summary : Two objects rendevous at the moon.Just a fifteen year old stargazer. I was on my deck watching the moon which was in a straight up southerly direction when a star like light approached the moon from the south and stopped beside it on the southeast side it was a full moon. I was so excited I got my mother and next door neighbors to come out and view it. While they were looking at it I decided to go through the apartment to see if anything else was coming and sure enough it was another star like light from the north. The second light approached the moon and stopped beside it on the west side. The two lights stayed by the moon for at least five minutes and then de- parted in their north, south routes. These objects were brighter than the satelites I&apos;ve seen and moved at an even steady pace. A police report/newspaper article was filed.
19980312	19980314	 Greenland, NH	 sphere	3 to 5 sec	I saw a glowing green sphere cross the sky horizontally east to westI  had just re-entered I-95 southbound from exit 3 near greenland New Hampshire, when I saw a green glowing sphere cross horizontally from east to west.I first saw the object in my drivers side mirror and then in my passengers side.The object appeared to be about the size of a baseball.I was driving a tractor trailer and immediatly turned on my cb radio and I was shocked to hear at least four other truck drivers had witnessed the same event, a green glowing sphere. I had also seen a strange looking airplane about twenty to thirty minutes prior to seeing the green sphere. The craft resembled a plane in nature but had strange x like wing pattern. I saw this x wing like plane first and dissmissed it as blurred vision from being on the road too long. The x wing type plane was seen through my front window while exiting I-95 at exit 3 to go the truck stop. I saw the green sphere getting back on the same exit, and thats when I began to question the first x wing like plane. I am not sure about the first plane like craft because it caught me off guard and happened quickly. The x wing craft appeared low to the ground and looked as though it could have been making a landing approach, again another reason why I had brushed this incident off at first. I did not have the cb on when I saw the first object, so I am not sure if it was seen by anybody else, or if my eyes were playing tricks on me. The green glowing sphere however I am sure about and had confirmed by speaking with other drivers who had also seen it.
19951224	19980530	 Pasadena, TX	 light	about 10 minutes	THE OBJECT WAS A LARGE RED BALL OF LIGHT. IT WAS DESCENDING SLOWLY, STRAIGHT DOWN.We were driving along in my father&apos;s truck, when the light was noticed. It was a very large red glowing ball of light, traveling straight downward at a controlled speed, as though it intended to land. There were no other lights visible on or near the object. We observed this for about ten minutes before it finally disappeared below the horizon. I later spoke to a friend of mine about it, describing what we saw. He said it could have been a Chinook helicopter flying under simulated combat conditions. Since the sighting took place at night, there is very little possibility that it could have been a blimp. Also, there are no vertical takeoff&#x5C;landing airplanes in the area. The only local airports are Hobby (civilian), Bush-Intercontinental (civilian) and Ellington Field(joint-use). The only witnesses that I am aware of were myself, my mother, and my father.
19980529	19980530	 Elmira (at drive in movie), NY	 triangle		It was a triangle of lights. There was a big light at the top and three little ones under it. I was at a drive in movie when it flew overhead, silently. It was heading south. from what I could make out that was the only one    /&#x5C; / 0&#x5C; /     &#x5C; /ooo&#x5C; --------- is kinda what it looked like.I was just sitting in my car watching a drive-in movie when it flew silently overhead. I wasn&apos;t the only witness I know that. My friend was there with me she saw it too. I don&apos;t know who else saw it though. It was heading to the south. It caused some engines on cars to start up and stop.
19980517	19980517	 Colorado Springs, CO	 light	10 seconds	small obj. size=bright star moving NNW to SSE altitude undetermined, but too low for satelite.  Light began to dim then we assume it climbed in altitude and disappeared within 2 seconds
19970806	19980228	 Aguila, AZ	 triangle	15 minutes	Large triange craft composed of 3 large white globes glided low over hiway in front of truck.  It searched the ground with beams of light.My husband and I were traveling at night from Quartzsite to Prescott Valley.  We saw a large lighted object approach the hiway from our left.  It traveled extremely slowly, to slow for something that size to stay in the air.  It appeared to be about the size of of an army tank and was absolutely silent.  As it approached, we stopped in the middle of the road to watch it.  It glided so slowly over the road right in front of us.  It was very low, only about 3 stories above us.  It was a triangular craft composed of 3 round globes of white light.  It was very bright, but it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  It was like looking at a soft-white light bulb.  It crossed the road, and when it got to the other side, it suddenly shot 3 wide beams of pale blue light down to the ground.  One from each globe.  It actually lit up the ground.  You cound see the cactus, rocks and all details.  It then started to sort of mosey back and forth as if it were searching the ground with the lights and looking at things.  Once or twice it slowed to a hover, and then almost as if disinterested, it sped up to a slow glide again. As it moved away from us, it just seemed to turn off all lights and disappeared.  We were amazed.  It was as if we just witnessed a miracle.  We finally continued on toward home.  As we started to climb into the mountains outside of Prescott, we pulled over to make a roadside rest stop.  We got out of the truck, and looked back down toward a little batch of houses down below us.  Suddenly a huge white globe of light just sort of &quot;turned on&quot; and just hovered over the town.  It was fairly high above the houses.  Then a small red &quot;dot&quot; just came out of the top 1/3 of it, and then flew around the big globe in a random pattern.  We watched it for about 8 minutes.  Then the red dot flew back to the same place it came out of.  Then the big globe just turned out like a light bulb and was gone.  My reality changed immediately from a UFO believer to a UFO knower.
19980528	19980528	 Tucker, GA	 changing	3-5minutes	a small group of lights flying in a birdlike formation slowly across the sky in a northeast direction.I saw a small group of lights floating slowly very high up in the air in a northeast direction. I was standing in a parking lot with one other person. As time passed the object changed shape as if it were an amorphous blob floating across the sky. I noticed this because I looked up to see what was making a loud noise and saw two military helicopters fly by travelling southeast. I noticed the blob at the same time. The blob was a group of small white lights. Then I saw what looked like a shooting star starting slightly east of the object. It went over the object and dissappeared and then the object itself faded away. I am a 24 year old married female and the other witness is an 18 year old male. We both work for a delivery service.  I think the shooting star was the object as it was leaving because immediately after i saw the shooting star the object faded away.
19980910	19980924	 Poway, CA	 flash	6 sec	Flash of the brightest light ever, fire colored, tail twice as long, travelling west to east,horizontally.  Was in the Union tribune on Sept. 11, 1998

19980924	19980924	 Modesto (North of), CA	 light	1 Second	I was driving northbound on Hwy 99, to the NW I saw what appeared to be a GREEN shooting star &quot;drop&quot; from the sky in a NW direction (from 30 - 20 deg).Object was the size of a shooting star.  Unusual in that it wasn&apos;t white, it was green.
19980608	19980611	 Salem, OR	 light	1min.50sec.	TWO PULSING LIGHTS PASSED FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON ON A NORTH TO SOUTH TRAJECTORYSTANDING IN BACK YARD NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE COMMERCIAL AIRLINER.AT FIRST LIGHT SEEMED TO BE NORMAL STROBE LIGHTS BUT THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING REALLY CAPTURED MY ATTENTION.. THERE WAS NO SOUND AND AS THEY NEARED I COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE YELLOW/WHITE,AND MUCH LARGER AND DEFINED COMPARED TO AIRLINER STROBE LIGHTS, ALSO THERE WERE NO RED/GREEN RUNNING LIGHTS
19980512	19980513	 Chebanse, IL	 disk	1-3 minutes	Last night we had severe thunderstorms. I was 7 or 8 minutes from home and out in the country. To my right up in the clouds I thought I saw a light. All of a sudden the sky lit up with lightning. At the point where I saw the light, Aball of light the size of the moon flashed on for 2-3 seconds then went out. I was thinking that a plane might have gotten struck by lightning. I know that lightning can do some strange things, and I did`nt think anything of it, til I got home, where my wife was freaking out about a disc shaped object she had seen in the soutern sky not more than ten minutes earlier. It was in the direction I was coming from, and it had been ten minutes earlier that I saw what I saw. I only saw a light and then the flash, She said that what she saw had a line of lights around the bottom. It moved back and forth over the tree line then blinked out. I`ve never seen a ufo to my knowledge. This is the first time for my wife too. I`d love to think that what we saw was alien. Thank You ((Name deleted))Already described in the above description.
19980504	19980508	 Moultrie, GA	 changing	45 mins.	It changed shapes slowly and was spinning slowly and it was creepy.They kept changing shapes, and spinning slowly, and the entire time, as you would see at a concert they were shining bright lights all over, but not steady, they were waving them all around. And the entire time stuff like the forks in the kitchen were sanding on end, my sons 4 wheeler wngine cut off, the air conditioner cut off and would turn back on until the left, then it turned right back on after they left, and wee were watching t.v. and it just started flipping through all the channels, and my daughters radio also started flipping through all the channels, both were electric, and the lights were flashing on and off. It also landded in the back of our field. I guess because the crafts were almost overtop of our house. The looked silver, but they kept lighting up with neon colors. Well, the viewers are our neighboors and my family, we all have jobs, high paying jobs, and this is just unusual, I would think I was crazy if everybody else hadn&apos;t seen it! Unfotuanatly I don;t have a video camera, and my neighboors wouldn&apos;t turn on, then once the left he tried turning it on and it turned on.
19970515	19980405	 Great River, NY	 oval	45 minutes	As I was leaving in my car from a building I happened to look up into the sky and noticed 6 hovering things.  I stopped my car and got out to look.  I couldn&apos;t beleive it.  I also saw a police car down the block with its flashing lights as if in response to this sight, I don&apos;t know.  I went back to the building to get some input from other people.  By that time the things had moved but were somewhat seeable if you looked.The objects were all the same size and were a gold/yellow color.  More of a blazing fire color.  At first they were just there, it a semi circle and I thought we were going to get attacked.  Sounds crazy, I know, but that&apos;s why I went back to the building I came from.  I was somewhat frightened but I really wanted another opinion on this.  It didn&apos;t help that a police car was up the block with its lights on.  One other person from the building saw what I saw.  Others tried to look but couldn&apos;t see anything.  As far as my memory will recall, it seems they would appear and then not appear, because they weren&apos;t easily seen after I went back for other opinions.  I must also add that after that event, throughout Long Island skies, I noticed these yellow color &quot;planes&quot; or things that would distract people while they were driving.  This thing would catch your eye in the sky as you&apos;re driving and you couldn&apos;t help watching it.  This may have caused some accidents.  Lasted about 2 weeks. A brief description of my background is that I am of sound mind, a mom of 3, and work for a living, like everyone else.
19980313	19980320	 Zoetermeer (Netherlands),	 light	3/4   minutes	I was looking through the window of my bethroom, watching the plains that flew by in the night. Suddenly I saw a bright orange licht that was floating behind a row of trees. While I was looking at it it began to accelerate till I lost sight of it. I don&apos;t now what it was, but it was surtenly no normal plane. bethroomAll details were naimed in the above mentioned description.
19980315	19980610	 Southaven, MS	 disk	20 min.	My Grandmother and I were going home on Hwy 51 in Southaven, MS when I saw a flying disk, metalic in nature move through the sky.My Grandmother and I were returning from the Walgreens on Hwy 51 at Bullfrog Corner.  We traveled south on Hwy 51 to the four way stop at the intersection of Church Rd. and Hwy 51. As we traveled south from Bullfrog Corner, I noticed a strange shiny light in the sky. The disk, metalic, moved from right to left, like a bee dancing. I watched for a few minutes to make sure. I informed my Grandmother, because I was that sure it wasn&apos;t a plane. She could not figure out what it was either. It moved in a southernly direction for a second. A green plane moved through the sky beneath the disk. The unidentifed object moved closer and then disappeared in the direstion of the plane. Down Church Road in that direction, in the woods, are large radar dishes fenced off from the road. A small airfield is at the end of the road.
19971120	19980511	 Rock Hill, NY	 triangle	1 minute	While driving west bound on Route 17 near Rock Hill, New York, my wife,son and myself saw a triangle shaped object moving across the highway diagnaly. The object was moving toward Pine Bush NY roughly.The object moved with very little sound, just a whisper of air movement but now large turbine or motor sound. It was dark but there were lights on all three sides of the object allowing to see that there was a center and it was solid not small planes flying in tight formation as the militatry sugests. The duration of the sighting was about one minute. Traffic was slightly heavy for that time of year and I did not have a camera or camcorder with me so pulling over was necessary. This object ot me was not a normal plane or like anything I have ever seen. I am not convinced it was full of little green men (but not oposed) but  it was not a plane or conventional aircraft by both visual or audio recognition.
19970424	19980217	 Clarion, PA	 light	~2:00 min.	It was a partly cloudy night in April 1997, the thursday following Easter Sunday.  My two friends and I were hanging out on the roof of my college apartment.  Two of us were lying down staring up at the sky. I saw this rather bright object in the sky between a break in the clouds.  It was blue in color and aparently stationary.  I thought it was a star. It then slowly disappeared as if it had &quot;winked&quot;.  My friend was evidently looking at the same object.  It then &quot;winked&quot; back, and we could see the light again.  It &quot;winked&quot; off, and then on again. Then it seemed to shoot off in a southwesterly direction.  I have no idea what it was.My summary description basically states all of what I had observed.  Being that I perceived the object to be simply a blue light high in the sky may seem a bit obscure as far as descriptions are concerned, but that is simply what it appeared to be.  Because I was in the middle of town where street lights abound, I do not beleive that either my friend or I could have resolved the object any more so due to the interference of the extraneous lights.  Pertaining to the observers, I would consider both of us to be at least highly open-minded individuals.  I, myself, have always had taken interest in supernatural/paranormal phenomena, although I cannot remember experiencing close encounters in my past.
19980227	19980227	 Bangor, ME	 flash	4 seconds	Spotted strange pulsing light flying at a high rate of speed north to south.Considering the proximity to the airport, I was hesitant to make this report.  However, being past this airport so many times, and never having seen anything that could explain this, I decided to.  It was a somewhat overcast night, and the lights of the town and airport were visible to my left as my girlfriend and I drove north on Interstate 95 towards Orono.  I noticed a flashing out of the corner of my eye and turned to see a white pulsing, circling flash moving VERY quickly across the sky in a southerly direction.  It pulsed intermittently, looking very much like a strobe but a bit slower.  It was out of site in only a few seconds, but the speed it moved at was not explainable by normal aircraft, nor was the strength of the light.  There was no plane attached to the light - just the light.  I saw a plane not a few minutes before that.  I told my girlfriend to look, but it was already out of site and she discounted it.  It was apparently close, only a few hundred feet up and it moved by flashing along, sort of in an incredibly gentle U-fashion to the south.  It was over a small line of trees and the town of Bangor.
19980607	19980609	 Cornville, AZ	 fireball	10 seconds	Large object, possibly a meteor or space debris flew into view in the southern sky, between Cornville and Phoenix, Az .Large object, possibly a meteor or space debris flew into view in the southern sky, between Cornville and Phoenix, Az .  Cornville is about 80 miles north of Phoenix, and 20 miles south of Sedona.There was a full moon that night, so the stars was hard to see, but not this object.It appeared to be very close about thirty to sixty miles away. It was very bright like a meteor but 500 hundred times brighter and closer. Even considering it was a full moon.When it descended below the tree line I lost sight of the object. One second later it then appeared to hit the earth.  At the time of impact there were two bright burst of light, from what appeared to be the point of impact. No sound was heard. It was Truly Breathtaking.  I have not heared any news reports about the incident.
19980422	19980507	 Yakima, WA	 circle	2-3 seconds	A strong light, a blue object, no noise, traveling south to north.After hearing Mr. Davenport on the Art Bell program I thought I should pass this on.  On or about 4-22-98 but definitely around 2130 hours, something illuminated my backyard as well as the entire area.  It was much like lightening but of shorter duration. I looked to the east and saw a round, blue object which instantly changed to red.  The object was traveling south to north at a high rate of speed with an altitude estimated to be 1500-3000 feet.  The downward descent angle I would estimate at 25-35 degrees.  There was no noise and the entire incident lasted 2-3 seconds.  I have not found another person who witnessed this incident. The night was clear and no storms nearby.  Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a member of law enforcement.  We have spoken with him via telephone, and we consider him to be exceptionally reliable.  PD))
19950215	19980523	 Lyndhurst, OH	 unknown	10 min.	Heard Loud, roaring , observed 3 strobing lights at 40 degrees above horizon , 20 degrees wide formation,  formation of lights was STATIONARY but moved slowy west.At 21:30 Feb 15, 1995, heard and felt loud, rumbling roar, like a jet.  Nearby small airport has planes usually flying nearby, thought it was one of them.  Roaring became louder and sustained over three minutes, so looked out West window.  Sky was overcast.  Observed three blue-white strobing lights similar to aircraft strobs in the following positions, indicated by an astriks and periods.  &quot;  *      .                .  &quot; The top left light would strobe or blink and the two bottom lights would blink off, then they in turn would blink while the top left would be off.  The sequence repeated in regular cycles of approximately one second.The window was opend.  Tempeture was near 25 degrees.  Roaring sound could be heard comming from the direction of the lights.  Secon witness was called (wife) who watched for a minute, commented that that can&apos;t be a plane since it was not moving.  In fact, lights were stationary.  Got out 7x35 binoculars but could not detect any observable shape.  Distance from one light on left to one on right was eight inches at arms length with naked eye.  Brillance of light was similar to venus and hour after sunset. As I watched, noticed lights seemed to be drifting due west.  Continued watching for nine minutes  as they indeed moved away at an incredably slow speed.  Just before dissapearing behind foortops in the distance, noticed the top left light drift or rotate towards the center light, then slightly back.  Then lights were out of sight. Third witness , 83 year old mother, heard loud roar and went from window to window.  She lives 4 miles due west.  She is hard of hearing but thought a truck was outside or something. Called Cuyahoga county airport at 22:30 to ask if any military craft was in the area, negitive response.  Called Cleveland Hopkins airport tower and received same respose, but was advised to call FAA the next day. Called FAA on 2-16-95 sometime in the late morning and reported what was seen.  Woman at FAA stated similar report had come in early that AM from Huron, Ohio where man reported &quot;fighter&quot; aircraft had been so loud and low that it broke several of his windows. Nothing ever turned up in local news.
19971001	19980427	 Charlotte, NC	 cigar	2 minutes	Cigar shaped, silvery-white object @ 500-1,00&apos; up, in a clear blue, cloudless sky.  Object was silent, immobile, and when I glanced down and then up (2 sec.) it disappeared.It was morning, around 9 AM while I was going to work.  I had stopped at a red light and glanced upward to see a cigar shaped object, @ 500-1000&quot; up, could not tell how big this was, perhaps 100&quot; in length.  It was very silvery, almost white, with the sun glinting on it.  There were no markings, as would be on an airplane.  No windows, no doors, no colors, no wings or fin.  It was completely stationary.  I stared at it for several seconds, trying to make out if it was an airplane.  It was completely silent and not moving at all.  I then glanced down to shift gears, then looked back up. It was gone.  This glancing down could not have taken more than  2 secs and when I looked up, it was gone.  I frantically searched the sky for it, thinking if it was an airplane it could have moved.  It was no where to be seen.  The sky was cloudless and bright blue.  Never found it again.
19980324	19980326	 Tempe, AZ	 triangle	10	Triangle shaped craft with three brightwhite lights and strobing colored lights dropped items behind treeline formed into one light and disappearedI was siting at a stop light and noticed what I thought was a plane out of the corner of my eye, when I looked at it though it was moving so slow accros the sky that it would have to be some distance away if it was a plane but the lights were so large that it had to be close.  I looked at it more carefully, it was three bright white lights in a triangle shape at a slight angle, lights strobed from red to green across the body of the craft then it changed direction and headed away from me, when the light went green I followed it, I only had to move 10 miles per hour to keep up with it.  It disappeared behind the tree line and I thought I saw it drop two or three objects (bright lights) but I can&apos;t be sure, it emerged from the tree line, strobed again then disappeared back under the tree line, when it reemerged it was a single white light, it then once again passed under the tree line and I lost it after that.  Not moments after I noticed an unusual amount of helecopters in the sky.
19980418	19980418	 Tampa (near), FL	 changing	40 seconds	We  (my wife and I and our 4 children) were headed south on Interstate 75 when to the west we saw (my wife and I) what appeared to be two craft, or other flying objects (I thought they may be too small for occupants), flying in a pattern much like two buterfly might but much faster.  They went up and down and covered a good distance in moments.  Then the larger of the two objects seperated into three and kept flying the same errratic flight in the same tight pattern that the two had made initially.  I stopped the car to see them better and did not see them again.  I am a school teacher in Ft Myers FL who has more than a passing interest in UFOs but cannot say for certain that I have ever spotted one before this.  My wife is a housemom.  What was odd about this was the length of time we were able to watch this. Because they were in constant motion and never kept one side facing us for any length of time it was hard to get a good look at the shape.  The closest description I could give would be spade shaped.  There were no lights or trails and the color appeared to be be between gray and black.  I heard about your site on Art Bell&apos;s show and hope to hear something about this there.  Hopefully someone was closer or able to see it standing still and was not going 80mph.
19900608	19980409	 Stonyford, CA	 sphere	20 sec.	neon green, round,traveled very very fast. no sound no flashing.MY SON WAS DRIVING ME HOME ON A 3 MILE SREATCH OF COUNTRY ROAD. I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A GREEN PINPOINT LIGHT BEHIND US. I STARTED TO ASK HIM IF HE SAW IT COMMING, AS IT WAS GETTING BIGGER FAST, SO I KNEW IT HAD TO REALLY BE MOVING AT A GOOD CLIP. I GOT &quot;DO YOU SEE&quot;..... SPOKEN, AS IT PASSED BY OUR CAR. HE SAW IT AND IT SCARED HIM SO BAD, HE WAS ALOVER THE ROAD.IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN FRONT OF US. IT WAS A MOONLESS NIGHT AND SO BLACK OUT THAT IT REALLY WAS HARD TO COMPARE THE SIZE TO ANYTHING. WE WERE SURROUNDED MY MOUNTAINS, BUT COULDN&apos;T SEE THEIR OUTLINE. THE THING THAT WAS MIND BOGGLING, WAS THE COLOR. IT WAS A FLOURESENT GREEN, NO LIGHT WAS AROUND IT, IT WAS HARD EDGED, I GUESS. HARD TO DISCRIBE, BUT NEITHER ONE WILL FORGET IT. I CAN SEE IT AS CLEAR AS IF I SAW IT YESTERDAY.
19980608	19980608	 Chesterfield, MO	 unknown	7 min.	See three UFO in a diamond formation causing electrical disturbances in area.I was logged-on my computer, and I started hearing this low humm, like a motor without a fan belt.  I looked out my window, and I see about 3 UFO in a diamond formation, hovering.  And I look at the street lights, and they start dimming low and would light back up at about 3 second intervals.

19980220	19980226	 Columbus, OH	 triangle	8 min.	I first noticed a long, thin, sort of cigar shaped bright white light slowly moving W to E behind my house. Upon looking out the window that was gone but, after several seconds 3 lights just came on, about 150 or 200 ft. up. They were in a triangular formation, the front being yellow, one red and one green. These lights made several odd manuvers and never flashed or blinked; we are realatively close to Port Columbus so, I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters yet, I have never seen anything like this.The long, bright white light was odd because it seemed to be close and flying very low,( 20-40 ft.), and even though this was a very intense bright white light it cast no light on surrounding objects. I could see the trees in my neighbor&apos;s yard silohetted against the light as it moved across the neighbor&apos;s yard. This object was about as long as the first joint of your finger,( from the tip of your finger to the first knuckle), held at arms length - as I sat about 22 ft. from the window that I saw it through. The triangular shaped object that I saw after I got up and went to the window appeared over the intersection of Morse &amp; Westerville Roads at an altitiude of about 100-150 ft. and headed due North, in my general direction. Once it got slightly North of Morse Rd.,( which runs E &amp; W), it banked slightly and headed west, the whole time going about 25-35 mph. The object traveled West until it was 200 ft. or so past Westerville Rd. then, came to a stop rotated 180 degrees and began flying back East at about the same speed as before. When the object got back to where it origanally began moving to the West it suddenly got a burst of speed like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen and made a U-turn that seemed to take it slightly higher and its own width to the South. This U-turn was one of the main things that made me stop and think &quot; Hey this is not a helicopter or airplane&quot; because, just last year I went to the Dayton Airshow and saw how fast these modern millitary planes can accelerate. Let me tell you nothing I have ever seen could do this- not to mention the g-forces this manuver would have exerted on a pilot would have been more than any human could ever stand. After this abrupt U-turn the object immediately returned to its previous snail like speed and continued on to the West. As it got about 300 ft. or so from Westerville Rd. it slowly turned to the South South West and as it made this turn all the lights instantly turned red but, there was no blink or flash as though I was seeing a different side of the object, the lights just simply switched colors!!!! After the object had changed course and color it just flew at the same slow speed out of my field of view to the Southwest. This triangular object seemed to emmit a wide, highly despirsed light at about a 45 degree angle, from the front yellow light- this light is totally different than a normal search light on a helicopter. It also seemed like there was a triangular shadow inbetween the lights so that since the sky was overcast the clouds were slightly brighter than the object itself- so, it was possible to make out the shape but, there was only a slight hint of it. The object appeared to be an equilateral triangle of about 50-75 ft. per side. I also stuck my head out the door during the sighting and heard no sound, other than the usual traffic sounds, and there was no change in the object&apos;s appearance.
19980516	19980517	 Manteca, CA	 triangle	45-50 second	object was flying from north to south.at arms length a silverdollar would have been the size.no noise,very low.2 large lights on bottom.solid object,til lights detached,one flew NE one NW.It was 10:30pm sat.(last-nite).I was laying on the divingboard, looking up at the sky.the sky seemed extra clear except, one large mass of low white cloud directly above me.It was long semi-wide and streched N to S.I was watching the cloud shape shift and change forms due to the wind.Then directly above me and a little to my right(north).I don&apos;t know if it caught my eye or just appeard.Below the already low clouds this large triangler object flying from N to S was at arms length, I approximate the size of a silver-dollar.The corners were all rounded.I was lookinging at the underneath part of the object.There was 2 very large circle lights.They did not glow like a light,the only way I can explain it is like the nite-lights you put in your house,the ones with the plastic white covers,how they look with light shining through them.That the closest I can explain how these lights glowed.The object itself was brown.It was below the white clouds so that allowed me to get a good clear look at it.There were no other lights whats so ever on the object.I stood up and started screaming my fiance&apos;s name,yelling look at this what is this!It continued to fly towards the south,about the speed of a jet,then as it got a ways to the left of me(south).I still had a good view due to the size,,it seems the end of the cloud may have hung lower than the rest of it, but was thinning out density wise. The object went into that part of the cloud I could still see it then the 2 lights that did seem to be a solid part of the object both at the same time in sync.widended out one to the left one to the right,moveded in little cirles in sync.the object was no longer visible,one light went back to the NE and one went back to the NW.Both moved in those directions what looked to be about 3inches in the skying,judging between my fingers and just went out or dissappeared.The rest of the object never came out of the clouds.IT made no noise,plane fly over all the time that low and you always hear them,helecopters that lw rattle the windows.Thi! s is close to the airport.I have had a very hard time even explaining yhis,and I did the best I could in words.Can you please let me know if anyone else reports this?

It was a cool night and the stars were visible in larger numbers. I noticed a light go at a pretty fast speed accross the night sky.  It moved much faster then a commercial aircraft and seemed to be at a high altitude.  It could not have been a military jet because they do not fly with lights on.  it was one light colored white with a small tint of yellow.  It raced accross the sky and fle away into an invisible distance. It flew straight from North to South.
19790515	19980614	 Wordens Pond Road, RI	 disk	15 min	A bright light appeared over the trees while driving home and  changed colors soon after that,.On June 15 1979 1:00am, I was returning home from visting my girl frend when I noticed a very bright white light moving slowly towards my car . I stopped to see what it was and noticed it was very close(250yrd) and  making no noise what so-ever. after 7-8 min the light was 200 yrds away then stopped, the white light went off, and began to flash 4 different color lights, the phosphorecent blue,yellow,reddish and green lights almost seemed to be alive like phosphorecents in the ocean that glow in the dark. I observed these lights for 5 min then the lights stopped pulsating and the white light came back on and began to slowly move back to where it came from, I watched it move slowly back over the trees and disappear not to be seen again. the object was around 50-60 feet in diameter, and was not a helicopter,plane or ballon.

Two crafts came into view &amp; Flew slowly across the skyMe &amp; two friends were just sitting on my dock talking when one of them noticed a light moving slowly across the sky about 1/2 mile off the ground.  It was much faster than any aircraft though.  The crafts had four yellow lights shining off of them.  They seemed to slow down infront of us &amp; then the craft in front shined a bright white light at us.  We just stood there, shocked, waiting to see if anything would happen finally after about 2 min. the crafts turned off the light &amp; then flew away VERY QUICKLY.  we then went home &amp; called the police.

19980215	19980513	 Toledo/Maumee, OH	 other	2.5 minutes	Large almost silent craftLarge Dark colored UFO. Chased by two Ohio Air National Guard F-16&apos;s.On or about 02/15/98 at approximately 23:35 Hrs. I observed a large Charcoal gray to Black UFO. This craft was slowly traversing the sky from North East to South West at between 1000 to 1500 feet in altitude. There was a very low more felt then heard rumbling coming from the craft as it moved. It was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and 100 feet wide at it&apos;s widest point. There were three strobing lights shifting from dull green to bright blue on this craft. One at each of its three tips. I would estimate the crafts origanal speed at between 150 and 200 MPH. This sighting took place within hearing distance of the local Airport extimated range to the airport is from 3 to 5 miles maybe more. As I spent 21 years in the military I know the sound of Combat Aircraft as they take off under full military power with after burners. I heard two Ohio Air National Gaurd F-16&apos;s take off from the Toledo Express Airport and head in the direction of the Unknown. Both F-16&apos;s passed directly over head I could clearly see they were both armed with two each AIM-9 Sidewinder Air to Air Heat Seeking Missles. As the two F-16&apos;s approched the craft it looked to me as if they were attempting to get a weapons lock. The large Unknow suddely increased it&apos;s speed to well over supersonic but without the resultent sonic boom. It then tilted upward at I would say an almost 90 degree angle and continued to excelerate. Both F-16&apos;s attemped to stay with and chase the craft but they were quickly out distanced. I continued to watch as they both broke off persute and circled back returning to their base at Toledo Express Airport. Again I state that the craft made a very low possibly subsonic rumbling sound that I felt more then heard. I would discribe it&apos;s shape as the same as the expiremental XF-16XL the Cranked Arrow (An expierimental Delta wing configuration of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. I should also note that my 21 years in the military was spent in and around the intelligence community. For 20 of thoes years I held a Top Secret Security clearance with several special compartmented acsesses granted. For the last 6 years I have worked as a private security officer and investigator. I do not know if there have been any other reports of this craft nor do I know if anyone else saw what I saw. I watched the newspapers and the television for any reports of this incident and I have yet to see any it is almost as if it never happend. And this concerns me more then if there had been reports and people were made to look like boobs for reporting it.
19960704	19980206	 Traverse City, MI	 other	30sec	I saw approx. 20 small pin points of light in a triangular formation. (almost like a group of birds flying south) The points of light resembled satellites as seen in the night sky, but the formation was strange. After about 30 second, the lights faded away.I was on the beach late on July 4th (the year Independance Day came out - everyone laughed when they heard my story) I love to look at the stars, and I had been looking at the sky for a few minuits when I saw a group of lights. They were all tiny pinpricks of light, like a satellite, but moving together in a V-shape, like birds. They all followed their own individual paths, but didn&apos;t break the V formation. The V shape also moved across the sky at a constant velocity. I am an astronomy and physics major, and I can&apos;t think of anything that can explain what I saw.
19980923	19980924	 Anson (just east of, on Hwy 180), TX	 fireball	2 seconds	I saw a baseball sized fireball, green with yellow and red sparks trailing it, for about 2 seconds and then it disappeared.I was driving east on Hwy. 180 between Anson and Breckenridge, TX shortly after 10 PM and I saw what I first thought was a bottle rocket in the field just off to my right and in front of me.  Then I realised that I was in the middle of Texas and the lights of the nearest town were not even in view so it was unlikely that anyone was sitting in that field setting off a single bottle rocket. Also, it was too big and travelling downwards from left to right trailing sparks behind. It was a baseball sized ball of green light trailing yellow and reddish sparks. So then I assumed I saw a meteorite, although I&apos;ve never seen one before, but I thought it was weird that I did&apos;nt see it hit the ground.  I was listening to Art Bell a few hours later and heard all sorts of reports about similar sounding sights, except I had felt that this was smaller and closer to me.  Of course, in the dark it&apos;s impossible to tell, but now I suppose that if it was actually very far away, that would explain why it disappeared, if it was falling behind a distant hill.  The land was pretty flat but there were a few hills. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars, but they are obviosly as distant as stars and in the upper sky, this was definitely within the atmosphere. As for my background info., I&apos;m 27, a bartender in New Orleans, and was travelling home from vacation with my boyfriend.  He did not see it because it was gone before I could say &quot;wow, look at that!&quot;
19960825	19980501	 Cahas National Park (Ecuador),	 flash	seconds	traveling by auto,11000ft. in Andes Mts, slowly, large &quot;silver&quot; mass not far above road level flew across in front of us.  We stoped and looked around but could see nothing in the air or down the Mts.I and my friend saw the object, I hold a BA and MA in History, amd had been a teacher for 38 yrs.    the other person is a Medical Doctor , surgion for many years. I an Ameircan living in Florida and he ,Ecuadorian .  We were traveling form Cuenca ,Ecuador , down out of the Andes Mts. to the coastal city of Guayaquill in the middle of the night. The doctors teenage son was sleeping in the back seat atthe time and we trid to awaiken him when we witnessed the even, but befroe we could get his attention the object had vanished, so as I recall the duration of our witnessing it was brief . My friend and I sat there for a few minutes rather shocked or in disbelief for a while and continued our trip. I didnot mention to him that I had seen simular things in the Rocky Mts. of the USA some years before.
19800915	19980308	 Dam B Lake (Just north of; ntersection of Angelina River), TX	 light	30 minutes	Two slow moving luminous flying craft observed along a high power transmission line in East TX.In the winter of 1980 my older brother and I were camping out at a hunting lease in East TX, located South of Sam Rayburn Lake. It was late in the night and the sky was clear and moonless. We where parked in a jeep cherokee near the edge of a high power line clearing. The area is far away from any cities and is very forested. My brother and I were talking and listining to the radio. We both noticed two low, slow moving lights about two miles away. The lights where visible in the distance because we were looking down (parallel) the high power line. After obseving the lights for a couple of minites we both ask each other if the other had noticed the lights. They were moving parallel with the power line and would soon be very near to us. At one time a beam of light shinning towards the ground came from one craft.We both became very frightend and I cranked up the jeep and drove hastily out of the treeless area and parked about 50 feet in the woods. We both grabbed our guns. I had never been so scared. I was shaking. I turned off the engine and rolled the window down. Looking straight up I saw one of the craft had moved straight above us. It was about 60 feet above the tree tops. The bottom of the craft looked very different. I recall a triangular pattern of amber lights with some long neon tube type lights also. The craft hovered above us for a few minutes. It made a continuos shhhhh sound. I thought we were about to be ether dead. But the craft moved slowly away keeping the same altitude. Fear left us as we figured, if the craft wanted to harm us it would have when it was above us. Our mood changed from complete fear to courisity. We put down our guns and ran into the opening under the high power lines for a better view. We noticed one craft had stayed back in stationary flight position while the other craft made a circular horizontal flight pattern which had taken it over the jeep and near the club house where the only other people where for a 10 to 15 mile radius. The roving craft returned near the stationary one and both hovered for a few minites. They both looked like to very bright spherical lights aganst a very star filled night sky.No blinking lights where seen. Then as we looked on hoping they would take us for a ride, they both shot silently into the upper atmoshere like a shooting star in reverse. This event blew our minds. We did not tell anybody for a couple of years. I was 16 years old at the time and my brother was in his mid 20&apos;s. He was a private pilot at the time. He knew the craft where way below stall speed for a conventional non helicopter type of flying craft. I think they used some type of EMF propulsion system.
19891015	19980309	 Morgantown, WV	 triangle	15 min	I was working as a DJ at WCLG in Morgantown WV.  I am sorry I dont know the date and am sorry that I am now reporting a 9 year old sighting.  But I finally found your website.  I started getting alot of calls about lights in the sky.  Between songs, I looked out the window and saw them too, creeping slowing across the sky, almost like a blimp, but with many colors, green, red, white, etc.  Continue at full description below...So I watched this large thing with flashing lights slowly move across the sky north of Morgantown West Virginia.  I am undertain of the exact date but I think it was on a warm fall Friday or Saturday night.  The lights were almost in the shape of a triangle, like a fat arrowhead.  They were not perfectly outlining the object but instead appeared somewhat at random.  The object would be stationary, then rise, and then move forward slowly again.  This went on for about 20 minutes.  I even announced it on the radio and I got even more calls from people who also saw it.  Finally, I went back to the window and it was gone about 20 minutes after I got the first call.  That is it.
19980517	19980518	 Kaleva, MI	 light	7 minutes	One light approached from the SE.  Another approached from the N.  Approached one another in close proximinity.  Did not come together.  Passed each other, barely, then stopped.  Altitude was very very high.  The light that approached from the North remained stationary.  The SE light changed direction and headed North.  It began to zig zag, then stopped, paused for a few seconds and then sped off really fast to the north, then just blinked out.   I don&apos;t know what happened to the other. I was to intent on watching the one moving.P.S.   The northern bound light turned red while zig-zagging, then back back to white,just before it sped off.((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD))

19970728	19980406	 Pete&apos;s Hole (near, a small lake in the Manti LaSal forest), UT	 triangle	12 min	A triangle shaped craft moved in over the tree tops and stood motionless for approx. 1 minute.  It then moved about in a jerky manner in a small cirlce for approx. 10-11 minutes. It was only about 100 feet up and it was of a dull gray color.  Small lights at each or its points were visible.  No windows could be seen.  There is now way in this world that is was a normal craft.  If the U.S. has such a craft it is beyond anything I or my family have ever seen or imagined.See above
19980531	19980531	 Fort Hood, TX	 light	30 sec.	The 3 shapes went into a formation of a triangle and hovered around for about 30 seconds.My cousin and I were coming back from a party. It was realy late so we had to hurry home. As we were walking, i looked up to see one bluish light almost directly above me. Almost immediatly after, to other lights came together to form a triangle. As it hovered, it went around in a circle. I was too scared to actually count the seconds it lasted, so 30 sec. is the closest approximation I could give. After a while the lights just dissapeared.

19980312	19980313	 Eagle County, CO	 fireball	00:01	I have seen 5 greenish/blue fireballs in the course of a 2 week period, above and around the Eagle County area of Colorado.I saw the first fireball on 02/27/98 at approximately 2150 hours, directly to my east, travel from south to north. I saw the second fireball on 03/03/98 at approximately 0225 hours, to the west of my location, again travelling south to north. The third was on 03/07/98 at approximately 0020 hours, slightly to my east, again moving from south to north. The fourth was on 03/09/98 at approximately 0445 hours, to my west, this one travelled from north to south. The fifth one I saw on 03/12/98 at 0110 hours, to my west and travelled from south to north. All these objects were intensely illuminated with a greenish or blue coloring. None of the objects showed the classic meteorite strieking appearence.  They did not break up as they moved, nor do they &apos;burn out&apos; as I have seen others do. They all seem to suddenly end and they are gone. I am a police officer and I have worked the graveyard shift in this area for the past 18 months. I have yet seen anything this frequent or this brillant in activity. I do not beleive they are &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; per say, but there is definately going on over Colorado that was not happening before. Thank you for your time.
19911115	19980203	 Colorado Springs, CO	 triangle	5 min	Clear night, calm winds, object triangular, blue glow emanating all around, flying at250 to 500 feet north to south direction no noise or soundAt 100 am while watching tv,, a voice came over the tv interfering with the reception said &quot;Look Out!&quot; in a strong comanding voice. To my amazement I did after thinking about it for several nights I decided to investigate ....At about the same time a week or so later....While looking out the window, with binoculars in hand, I chose a good background of stars to pass the time when suddenly an object came into view...to my amazement this object floated carelessly toward me. At first I didnt know what to think and I started to get nervous,..... as I waited my heart began to race in anticipation to what this could be. As it drew closer I knew that this was something not of this earth ,because of the strange glow it had and how perfectly its color matched the stars, triangular in shape bigger than a C-5 military cargo plane and no sound.. It was very inconspicuous and frightening to say the least because of the way it so effortlessly moved, ever so slowy through the sky..as if to say to the observer here i am and there is nothing you can do to stop me! thats when I dropped the binoculars and looked at it as it passed over head ...Immediately i focused on the door knob to see if this thing was coming to get me as i could no longer see it overhead.....I immediatly woke my wife and called my brother who was at home but works at NORAD as a sergent in the airforce..further more I am an aircraft mechanic, FAA certified...and I know it was not ours ...Nor was it a STEALTH aircraft but i must say now i know where we got part of this technology.....more sightings to be continued .......
19980307	19980323	 Temple Terrace, FL	 light	60 seconds	Traveling east spotted two white lights 30 degrees elevation. They were strangely foggy in appearance but moved independently.  No craft visible.Returning home from work on March 7, 1998, I turned east on Bullard Parkway off 56th street in Temple Terrace, Florida.  My attention was drawn to two bright white lights aboput 30 degrees above the horizon and visible in my windshield.  They were strangely out of focus or hazy.  They moved independently from one another, i.e. they tilted.  Each was more or less formless, but also strangely each seemed to have a shaft of light pointing down as though each light was fastened to the bottom of an aircraft and pointed straight down.  But the shafts of light were not vertical cylindars, but truncated cones of white light.  Neither pointed down very far.  I estimated that they were less than one mile away and perhaps 2000 feet high, given their brightness.  I became concerned tgaht I would drive under them and lose sight of them, but it did not occur to me to stop off the highway and get out to look up. As I drew closer they were higher in my windshield, so I moved forward against the steering wheel to keep them in sight.  Before I reach my turn off the right hand light faded and disappeared, then the second light faded and disappeared.  They were rather peculiar, so I was at first reluctant to tell my wife, but I finally did before we went out for the evening.  I checked the sky as we left home about 7:30 but they were not to be seen.  I was relieved to see a haze in the sky then, as that would explain their foggy or out of focus appearance.  On the other hand the cloud layer was much to high to have had an effect.  I do not wish my name to be used!(NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))

Moved slowly to left and up then sharp right, followed by descent to ground. Obscurred by trees lightening flashes to left and right of sphere. Suspected &apos;ball lightening&apos; but authorities on subjects say largest are 100cm?!! This is why I am reporting as a sighting...
19870715	19980330	 Lakeville, CT	 chevron	45 mins	The wife and I were driving home when we saw in the west a &quot;V&quot; shaped pattern of lights flying north. It then made a 180 deg turn to the south.  We raced down to the main road to follow it. As we neared Lakeville it was just dropping out of sight. We went into the lounge at Interlaken Inn and reported to our friends. They too had ran outside to watch it. It flew over at abt 1000 ft. and made no sound. The nite was clear &amp; many small planes were flying. The lights were very white and steady. This was the second time I&apos;ve seen it.
19980111	19980201	 Rachel, NV	 disk	8 minutes	Summary : At approximately 8:10 PM MST, my girlfriend and I were driving north towards Rachel on Highway 375 in Nevada.  As we descended from Hancock&apos;s Summit, I noticed a light skirting the ridgeline that surrounds Area 51 to our left several miles in the distance.  We took app. 8 minutes of videotape of this object.The object is reddish-orange, and appears to be a typical disc-shaped UFO turned on its face.  At first I thought the camcorder was out of focus, but later in the footage, half of the object is clearly obscured by the mountains.  The object was a minimum of 13 miles away (I need to get a detailed map of the area with correct scale to figure out an exact minimum distance).  The object blinks, changes in luminosity, disappears and reappears, gets enormous, moves a great distance to the right and back again in an instant (although this may be camera motion), moves quickly to the right and disappears.  The object&apos;s structure is readily apparent in the video:  a disc with a ring around the outer edge, and a darker &quot;hub&quot; in the middle. I was shown another video clip of the same object in Rachel the next day--much better quality, but without the mountains as a frame of reference.  There are four groups doing analysis on my tape, and the footage will be posted on my website and several others when analysis is completed.
19831201	19980217	 Madison, WI	 unknown	2.5 minutes	Object moving slowly down a row of homes. Crossed boulevard and disappeared over warehouse. drove under it thinking it a police helicopter dowing surveilance.  Very disturbing and panicked when eyes met driver of on coming traffic who witnessed same.Ok, so it bothers you&apos;re web site doesn&apos;t make any mention of this because it was in the local paper the following day as having been witnessed by a cop patroling Milwaukee Street.  Anyway as for my experience I was coming home from the Univ of Wisc Madison&apos;s library and it was late and very cold out.  I pull up to the light going northbound on Johnson Street (just past Tenney park near the police repair shop and old paint warehouses) and about 15 feet above the roof of this house down Johnson Street on my right is this thing.  It was black, but appeared illuminated - kinda dim like - underneath.  I didn&apos;t think much about it. Thought it was probably a police helicopter searching the neighborhood for some East High School punks.  But it kept my attention cause it wasn&apos;t really a spot light eminanting shining down into backyards.  Also it didn&apos;t have any blinking helicopter like lights on top.  What ever it was doing it was moving slow, steady and smooth and kept following over the row of roofs.  From what I could see it look like a rounded off van with a fat base.  My light changed and I started on my way about the same time the &quot;helicopter&quot; finished with the roofs and was headed across the street.  Alot of observations started coming real fast as I approached to go under it.  It was about 15 feet off the ground.  It was uniform in its black color but had definite seams. No windows. The one distinct feature I remember the most was a cross like seam (real pronounced like) on its belly.  This is about when all the contradictions started pooring in.  First off, there was loose snow - if it was a helicopter how come it wasn&apos;t kicking up snow?  And the bushes in the boulevard - they didn&apos;t twitch like they were caught in any chopper wash either.  I remember shutting the heater off and coasting without the gas peddle down so I could hear the helicopter.  Helicopters are noisy but none of the houses had woken up, and I wasn&apos;t hearing anything and I was right underneath it. And I felt kinda funny passing underne! ath it.  The car reacted like it was mildly buffeted by helicopter wash and I can recall kinda of a slow down.  And something was wrong about the illumination it was casting down. The light was dim but clear and the shrub branches kind of reflected like hotdogs under a heat lamp at the gas station.  So I realize now somethings fundamentally wrong.  I take my foot of the gas and this thing rises slowly to pass over the warehouse just beyond the oncoming lane&apos;s traffic.  I&apos;m borderline freaking out and so this guy in this big vanilla colored older model chevy (the kind that seats about twenty) is coming at me in the oncoming traffic lane and he&apos;s got his face like smashed up against the windshield over his steering wheel looking real hard at what ever the thing was.  And he gives me this blank big eyed look.  After that I this wasn&apos;t right and went  right into an adreniline pump that kept me pacing when I got home for at least a half an hour.  The next day it was the newspaper being reported as mussing around on the far east side.  I really try not to talk about this.  And if I&apos;m not sure I think I entered this same experience into this web site before - it feels good to say something.
19970301	19980526	 Dorchester, MA	 unknown	unknown	Recentlt while attending a house party that friends of mine were hosting for Memorial Day Iwas invited by the host to see something strange that appeared overnite on property adjacent to his home. He led another friend of ours along with myself through a small thicket of trees to a clearing just beyond a small baseball field. what we saw was the strangest thing, an almost perfect circle measuring approximately 60 or 70 feet across burnt into the ground. The ground looked like it had been boiled(for lack of a better descrip tion). the trees that had been there just disappeared, no charred hulks you would normally would find after a brush fire,just gone. the wildest though is the soil that exsist today is almost looks like lava but very brittle wich is completely out of character of the surronding soil. in fact the ground dirt is only a couple of inches thick due the fact that this location is on top of a large granite ledge. I would be happy to send a sample of this area to anyone who is serius about doing some kind of analysis on this &quot;dirt&quot;. I will (by permission of the land owner) give the location of this area for scientific (serius inqueries only) study.

19960101	19980613	 Key Largo, FL	 triangle	3-4 min	3:30 in the morning observe a black triangular shaped craft fly directly over Key Largo  Fl. aproximately one tholusand ft. up and 2000 Ft north of the bell south tower at the Howard Johnston Restarant.  Size would be about one hundered + or - a small amount.  Completely blackened and traveling at about 35 miles per hour, no lights and no reflection other than off the upper edge of the fuselage.I was anchored in tarpon basin which is just off the howard johnston restaurant and adjacet to the tower which placed the tower north by east of out boat.  This was in jan 1996 just prior to crossing to the Bahamas.  I got up to check out the anchor and went on deck as it was a clear warm night,looking up I noticed a line of white being reflected in a diagaonal formation to it`s line of travel looking and traveling somewhat like a flight of birds. A split second later I realized that it was a hard edge reflecting light back towards me ,but not down.  We sailors always have binocullars available so I was able to get a better view immediately.  Being 50mm lens and having good light gathering ability I was able to see the bottom somewhat,; it appeard featurless. At this point I called Connie on deck and gave her the binocs and she was able to see it also. At this time it was impossible to see with the naked eye.  I again watched it go slowely to the northwest  until it completely  blended into the night sky. It was easy to judge the hight and size due to it`s close proximity to the tower.  My background as a private pilot and having built and flown my  own planes and ultrlights allowed me to judge the speed.  As low as it was we both were able to trade off the glasses and abserve the progress.  I am a retired teacher and have been 22 years most of which  I have been captain and used to reporting factual reports.
19790131	19980519	 Houston, TX	 rectangle	10 minutes	I saw a grey rectangular patch against blue sky, thru binoculars.While watching an ultra light aircraft demonstration, using binoculars, I saw almost directly overhead a light grey rectangular shape against the blue sky. I was looking almost straight up. The rectangular shape had clearly defined edges. The long part of the rectangle was oriented east/west. I looked back at the shape several times in the next few minutes. I always located it quickly in the same spot. It looked like a patch on the sky. There were other spectators around, but none with binoculars. I didn&apos;t mention it to anyone, because the demonstration had everyone&apos;s attention. After a few minutes, I became very concerned that there was going to be a violent accident with the ultra light aircraft, because the pilot was trying aerobatics in the flimsy craft. I left in my vehicle. I have never mentioned this incident to anyone, nor have I ever again seen anything similar. I am a 69 year old retired banker, a former computer progammer and I was a control tower operator in the Air Force in the late 1940&apos;s.
19980430	19980502	 Danville, VA	 teardrop	5mins	Observed small upsidedown  curved black teardrop with blue floresent crown hovering over highway 86 Danville.I was in the car with my mother on Highway 85 going toward the mall when I spotted a black, upside down, curved, tearshaped object hovering over the highway. My mother, who was driveing, thought it might be a kite or a balloon and ignored it. I got a good look at it and it was a very strange shape. It didn&apos;t look like any kite or balloon to me. It had a blue floresent auric discharge over the top which realy made it UFO like...It was about 7ft tall and 3ft wide, hovering 500ft above the road. We drove right under it and continued to our destination. When we returned a few minutes later it was gone.
19980206	19980327	 Emporia, KS	 light	15 sec	three different lights moving slowly about the size of average stars the first one dissappeared and then at the same time three or four airplanes were circling the area possibly watching.  and then five mins later two more lights one following the other were moveing the same dir and dissapeared after 15 secsI was watching trains at the Emporia depot at around 7pm sometime in early Feb 98.  Sometimes when i&apos;m waiting for a train and its dark out i look at the sky hoping to get a glimpse of a ufo.  I was wathcing for 15 mins and then noticed a light that looked like a star moving northeast and i was looking southeast .  I also noticed an airplane circling the sky in that area it went east and coming from the south was another airplane with another plane beside it circling.  i lost track of the moving light while watch theplanes. about 3-5 mins later after the planes were out of site looking south i seen 2 more lights one foollowing the first moving norteast.  this time i wasn&apos;t going to loose sigth of them.  but watching them for about 15 secs and they just went out or dissapeared.  the lights looked like moving stars except stars don&apos;t move like that.

It was to the south about 11 o clock if facing west and looking S. to N. there are mountains all around (( the Big Horns )) the sky was Clear i just looked up and saw what looked like a star but ive never seen a star move in the the direction of a octagon and I went in the builing to get my bill of lading for my load of fuel and came back out and seen it moving in a triangular motion I thought i was doing it w/ my eyes thinking it was in my head so i held my head w/ both hands to be sure i wasn&apos;t moving my head...and low and behold I WASN&quot;T...it lasted about 10 -15 min..and then it was gone..
19980130	19980131	 Dallas, TX	 light	3.5 minutes	Time: 1850 CST; location: 40nm SSW Dallas; altitude: 6000feet I am a pilot. I was flying into the DFW metroplex on the evening of January 30, 1998. It was a clear night. At approximately 6:50 local time, I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star above and slightly to the right of my course. This object was very high and accelerating, albeit slowly. I thought that it was a meteor, at first. I noticed its acceleration and gave extreme notice. It was then that I noticed the second object ahead of the first and traveling in the same direction (north). The second object was much smaller and less bright. Both objects moved to within a few degrees of directly north. The first object began a slight, curving turn to the left and began to fade away ( as if to move into the earths shadow ). A few seconds later, the second object faded from view and with no turning noticed, as with the preceding object. They disappeared in the reference vicinity of two stars to the distant left and &apos;below&apos; teh orion constellation. I notified a friend who was behind me by some miles in his aircraft (40 - 50 nm). He remarked that it was probably an aircraft, given the large number of them in the area. This was not possible. I have seen aircraft all of my life. These objects had none of the characteristics of aircraft and were either in the extreme upper atmoshere or in space. They looked very similar to satellites moving overhead. This is unlikely, in my opinion, due to the fact that the first object began a slight, parabolic turn to my left. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial sighting, the objects reappeared in the same fasion as before. They moved in the same fashion and direction as previously noticed. The smaller object was in the lead, as before. I noticed them this second time directly above. They moved in the same direction as before in almost an identical path. The fact that I saw them a second time is why I am writing this. If these objects were satellites, they would not have been seen twice, moving in identical fashion along the same route. During this second sighting, the! re was no turning motion seen. They were directly in tandem and some distance apart. My friend behind me observed the same phenomenon and stated that he saw the objects turn slowly to the right. I did not observe this. I did observe that they &apos;faded&apos; from view in virtually the same position as before. They were not seen again. Approximately 2 minutes after the second sighting, I queried ATC to the effect of &apos; did they see two objects very high directly above Dallas aand at extreme altitude&apos;. The response was &apos;negative&apos;. I have a question for my reader-Does the space shuttle move south-north? Is it capable of retracing its path in a very short time, in what must have been a large distance? Can it turn in orbit to appear to be curving to one side? This is the only possible solution I can give. Given the fact that there were two objects, I am at a loss for an explanation.

19971015	19980315	 Duncan, OK	 unknown	05:15	This is what I can remember about my abduction.In the wee hours of the morning of October 15th, 1997 at about 2:15 A.M. I was sleeping in my bed when I suddenly woke from my sleep from a strange presence in my room. I was positioned in such a way, that I could see my clock. The time read 2:15 A.M. 	I was laying on my back and for some reason, an odd feeling swept through my body. This ( feeling ), forced me to close my eyelids. The next thing I knew, was that I was laying on my stomach, looking up at the clock which now read 5:15 A.M. The strange presence was still in the room with me and once again I was forced to close my eyelids. At this time, I was asleep, only to be awakened by my alarm clock at 6:15 A.M. 	When I first woke up, I did not even remember the odd events of the night before. However, the images soon came. As I woke up, I started to remember some of the events. The strange presence at 2:15 A.M. , and something else. The image was so vivid, it could have not been a dream. 	Just after I had been forced to close my eyes, I could remember standing naked in an oval shaped room. The walls were metal, with small windows in the top right hand corner. ( They looked like the ones in grocery stores. The place were they can watch every alley from above with the two way mirror glass. ) Directly behind me was a large door where the two oval walls meet. In the middle of the room, was an odd looking operating table with two needle devices on robotic arms sticking out of the side. This was the only object in the room. 	I turned in fear and started banging on the large door, demanding that I be let out. I could hear voices in the background of my head, yet there was no noise except for a low humm in the walls. I was then told by an angry male voice in my head to either lay down on the table and do as I was told or someone I loved would be hurt. Fearing this would actually happen, I did as I was told. I was asked to lay in such a manner that my left hand lower back was exposed to the two needle like objects. One of the objects had a clear window on it and I could see the contents. what ever was inside of it was clear.  At the base of the needle was a triangle shaped piece of metal and two rectangle designs on both sides of the objects. I was told by a more friendly female voice that I would feel no pain but I would feel my legs go numb and would feel that I could not move even though I could if I wished. 	As I laid there, the robotic arm moved closer to my back and suddenly plunged into my lower left hand side of my back. I could feel the clear liquid being pushed into my body. Then suddenly, I felt numb and paralyzed. I tried to move my arm and I discovered that I could still move. By this time, the needle had been inside of me for over a minute. Then the needle started to suck instead of inject. Then it moved out and away from my back. At this time, the second needle moved toward the same spot on my back and plunged in. 	It was at this time I work up laying on my stomach looking up at the clock that read 5:15 A.M. As I brushed my teeth that morning, I noticed that I had a small pain in my back near my kidneys. I lifted my shirt to discover physical evidence of my abduction. There on my lower back was a triangle with two rectangle shaped imprints on my back. They were the same size as the needle on the table. In the middle of the triangle was a small spot of clotted blood. I removed the spot of blood only to discover that there was no entry hole, just dried blood and the three imprints. My back was slightly swollen and did hurt a little bit. I took of my shirt to look and see if blood was also on it. There was none, it was only on my back.
19980516	19980516	 Andover, MN	 light	7 minutes	my brothers and i thought we were looking at a shooting star that started moving in diferent directions as it started moving away and getting harder to see we saw 2 of them of in the distance I tried to tape it but it was to dark out for the camcorder to worka star or sphere Blueish-greenish or star colored shaped object was moving across  the sky first in a straight line so I thought it was a shooting star so I lold my brothers to look at a shooting star. but I couldn&apos;t find it, then my youngest brother pointed out an object circaling above in the sky i tried to record it but my camcorder wouldn&apos;t pic up even the stars as it moved into the distance it became harder to see them off inthe distance we could slightly see two more off in the distance then we couldn&apos;t see them anymore. closer to the ground probably 300 feet off the ground
19610901	19980613	 Fort Benning, GA	 disk	10&apos;	a bright silvery on edge object was observed by my father with at least 3 witnesses. it was observed &quot;hanging&quot; in the sky over Lawson Field at Ft. Benning for several minutes. Suddenly it moved, accelerating at such a velocity that it appeared to exhibit white &quot;steam&quot; behind it as it moved at at least 1,000 mph toward the west until it was no longer visible due to distance.My father reported this to me one day at the dinner table. I know this to be true as he was a sceptic and said if other witnesses had not seen the same thing he saw he would&apos;ve not accepted it as real. Several of his co-workers were with him at the time as they all viewed it together and therefore he &quot;had&quot; to believe that it was true.
19761127	19980326	 Stead Nevada (outside of Reno), NV	 disk	3-5min	It was Thanksgiving 1975 or 76. When I came out of our house it was hovering over our neighbors one story house. It was daylight and I could see it very well. I remember thinking its too small for a tall man to stand up in. It had small porthole type windows all around it. And I couldn&apos;t look in them first because I was afraid something would be looking back out at me. I looked at the edge of the disk.It had red blue green and white lights that strobbed all around it. It was silver but not shiny. No seams at all and no noise. I finally looked at the windows and the inside of the ship was lite up like a bright light bulb. There was nothing inside. It looked empty. Just a brightness like the sun. I remember thinking. I wish I knew about machanical things because I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m looking at. The bottom was smooth. Then all of a sudden I came out of what I thought was a stupid curiosity I took off running to anouther neighbors house. I remember I was the only one outside when this happened. but it was in the newspaper the next day. Alot of people saw it. I think I was the closest though. If anyone else saw it too. Please email me. It has haunted me for all these years. I just wish I could make anyone believe how important it was. No one will know what its like until it happens to them.
19980115	19980116	 Lake City, CO	 light	30 seconds	Summary : An object the size and brightness of Venus appeared in southern sky for appoximately 30 seconds.   It then gradually doubled and size and then, like a dissolve light switch, the gold like orb went back into darkness.  No trace of its existence was apparent after my sighting.Observer:   Amateur astronomer Lake City, CO 81235 I do my main stargazing on my dark morning walks.  I have become quite familiar with the many aspects of our universe and especially sighting meteors in all their various shapes and sizes. What I saw the morning of January 15 , 1998 was different than anything I have ever observed.  At approximately 5 a.m., I spotted what appeared to be Venus in the southern sky.  Realizing that that couldn&apos;t be the case, I stared intently at an object which grew at least twice the size and brightness of Venus.  Then, as if someone turned a dissolve switch, this object reversed its growth to nothing but dark. I did not observe any other light source after witnessing this remarkable phenomenon.
19970922	19980422	 Palo, MI	 cigar	6 minutes	I was sitting outside on the Phone with a friend when I looked up and saw a silent, cigar shaped craft flying west to east due north of me.My friend on the phone was also watching the craft from her house.I was outside talking to a friend on the phone and I looked up only to see a silent, quickly moving craft. The craft was travelling west to east due north of me. The craft was flying rather low also. Without saying anything to my friend she asked if I saw what she did. We were both watching the same craft. It quickly moved out of range and we haven&apos;t seen anything similar since.

The poultry, neighbors&apos; horses, and dogs all stopped in their tracks.  One dog, Butch, sat down and stared up toward the craft. The craft flew straight up, paused for a moment then zipped away toward Mt. St. Helen&apos;s NW side. All animals resumed normal activities when craft was gone.
19980923	19980925	 Schenectady, NY	 sphere	15 seconds	Bright green-white light flying soundlessly overheadI&apos;m an 8-year veteran police officer. While leaving for work on a crisp, cold, clear, starlight morning I stopped before entering my jeep. Above, against a starlight night, I saw a green-white orb traveling southeast through the sky. It was twice as bright as the North Star, soundless, and traveling half as fast as a shooting star--much faster than any plane I&apos;ve ever seen. There were no other navagation or strobe lights on it. I was alone and thought it odd. I felt no strange paralysis or anything like that; I just watched it fluedly traverse the sky in one straight, quick, silent slash then I went to work. I only saw this one object. It seemed far away, high in the sky, much too bright to be a star, and much too fast to be a plane. I&apos;m a well educated person and a realist. I don&apos;t know if there are any spooky grey beings out there or what our government is testing. But I know I witnessed something I&apos;ve never seen before and I thought you should know about it.
19980326	19980404	 Beautiful Home Community of Monroe County, KY	 light	2min.	A large white light, moving from north to east.I watched this large white light come closer to me as I set on back of pick-up ,in the yard .I was a little scared when I first saw it, but the longer I watched it the more scared I became, because it getting closer and I felt as if it was coming after me. I was so scared I jumped in the truck and took off, I didn&apos;t stay around to see where it went. It was not of this wourld. I am a mature 19 year old farm girl who isn&apos;t afraid of much. I called my dad and told him and mom what I had saw. I was really upset, this was not a happy experence because I was horrified.
19980923	19980923	 Seattle, WA	 fireball	5-8 seconds	While travelling south on highway 509 (south of 1st south bridge), a greenish fireball observed in SouthWest sky at about 10 o&apos;clock high, moving to the west. The fireball was moving to the west, and disappeared over a hill to my right.The object looked like a green fireball, with a long tail. I was travelling home on the freeway named above, and looked up just in time to see this green fireball.  I thought it was strange, since it was big enough to be very close, yet it did not die out, like fireworks would do.  It just kept moving towards the west, and then disappeared over the hill on my right (out of view).  There was one other person with me in the car, but that person was talking and did not see it.  It did not give it any more thought, until I turned on the Art Bell show, and heard a lady in Seattle call in and describe the very thing that I had just seen. I know the time was right about 9:10pm, because I had just left a store in the University District, and the travel time to the point of observation was about ten minutes.
19770601	19980513	 Houtzdale R.D., PA	 egg	five minutes	While driving south on Route 53 with my brother, we were exiting a thunderstorm.  Leaves, trees and branches were moving violently.  It had been raining hard.  It had stopped raining.  As we were coming up on a plateau where a silo, cow barn and cow field are located, we saw a light hovering above the cow pasture.  We saw this light at 1/4 miles from plateau.  My brother and I watched the light as we approached the plateau, not saying anything. Almost like we were in shock, I mentioned &quot;What was this?&quot; He acknowledged the same.  We sped up and started approaching the hill to the plateau. As we came to approximately 100 yards, the object started to move. It had been hovering approx. 75-100 yards above the cow pasture. The object was round and orange-yellow in color. It was maybe 5-6 feet around. There was no sound.  It took off and sped toward the ridge.  I sped the auto to app. 85 mph to catch up.  I was flashing the lights of the auto and blowing the horn.  Personally, I felt as if our metallic presence of the auto was making the object move.  It moved as we made our closest point of approach.  Unusually, the object stopped at the ridge.  It could have been our perception, but it appeared to stop before going out of sight.  I had stopped the car and got out and yelled at it.  I told my brother that if it were extra-terrestial, then I wanted to meet them. My brother and I travel down into the valley to cross another ridge. I had presumed that if it did land, then it was on top of the hill. We went down into the valley and lost sight of the object. My brother became terrified to go up on the hill to look for it.  As we looked for something, I had felt that something was there and maybe it had landed. My brother did not want me to get out of the car.  I did and I felt a strange sensation believing that there was something outside, possibly that this object had landed. This was many years ago in the 70&apos;s in approx. 1977 or 78.  I would have cast off this sighting as something not worth mentioning but my brother had another sighting of the round object recently.  He delivers newspapers in the early morning before dawn.  I will get more info from him if you want. I did not see it recently but I always remember the sighting.  I just got out of the Navy and I never knew where to report objects.  Thanks and you can write back if you want more info.  Thanks. ((Name deleted))

19980319	19980320	 Spring Hill, TN	 light	20 minutes	It was a light formation containing 5 lights regularly spaced moving in a circular pattern. These lights were fuzzy edged like headlights seen through a fog. One light came out of the circle monentarily, and then returned to its orginal position. One observer thought the lights had a greenish tint however 2 other observers thought the lights were white. These 3 observers were in 3 different locations. This sighting took place during the beginnings of an electrical storm. Lightning and thunder and wind were present. Moments prior to the rain beginning the lights began to move away in a southerly direction becoming gradually less distinct more distant until invisible.
19980528	19980528	 Santa Fe, NM	 fireball	7 min.	We saw the object in the sky south of Santa Fe just after sunset. It looked like a glowing white sphere against the indigo sky, and was the only celestial object visible other than the crescent moon. It was approximately 20 times the size of a typical star. It remained completely stationary in the sky throughout the course of our sighting. The object brightened then faded several times, and after a few minutes, it began to shrink in size and fade in brightness, shrinking to the size of a typical star over the course of about 30 seconds. This star-sized object was visible for at least a few more minutes.A friend, her two daughters, and myself were on our way out to dinner. We got in my truck around 8:30 p.m. and were heading south out of my driveway when I saw the object and pointed it out to the others. We stopped the truck and my friend&apos;s daughter ran back to the house to get her binoculars. We stood in the driveway and observed the sighting as reported above. The object was obviously distant. There is no way to estimate its actual size or location.

19960715	19980210	 Ellensburg, WA	 rectangle	3 mins.	Clear sunny day, 3 adults saw small silver sphere that hovered for about 1 minute directly overhead. It then suddenly took off to the east at extreme velocity.We went out to look at some real estate just east of town on a clear summer afternoon. My wife, brother-in-law and sister were there. We had just finished looking at this home and were outside looking up at a lot of gnats just twenty feet in the air, when my brother-in-law said look! I said yeah I see the gnats, but he said no, farther up in the sky. Then I focused my eyes much farther up and saw a small silver sphere which hovered in one spot. As we (my wife, brother-in-law and myself) were watching, this small sphere suddenly at break-neck speed moved in a staight line towards the east of the valley. It was as though as soon as we noticed this thing, it decided to leave! I am a medical technologist and also an Army reservist. My wife is a homemaker and my brother-in-law is a disabled veteran. We are all in our forties and have never witnessed anything like this before. There was no exhaust trail or flashing lights. We didn&apos;t see any other spheres or aircraft in the sky . There was no sound. I initially thought maybe it was a silver birthday balloon, but what I don&apos;t understand is why it stood directly overhead and didn&apos;t move, then all of a sudden moved at an extreme velocity in a straight line and was out of sight in about 3 seconds. We didn&apos;t report the sighting to authorities because we were still wondering about it. I did tell some of my co-workers friends and relatives about what we saw. We didn&apos;t have a camera or video camera at the time of the sighting.
19680628	19980517	 Cottonwood, AZ	 circle	45 mn.	It was dusk and still very warm, so my family and I went out on our porch to cool off. The porch faced west toward Mingus Mountain, we were just setting there discussing our days events. As the conversation slowed my sister and I noticed about the same time an odd light rising over the mountain. As it got about three fingers high, it suddenly lit up the whole valley, like it was dusk, which by this time it was dark. It was oval shaped, and just hovered there for about half an hour. Then the light went out slowly until it was a small light and dark out. All of a sudden two more lights merged with the other and hovered there for a couple of seconds and then shot off to the North,and then there was only the dark sky and stars. It was a beautiful sight, I wont forget.

The space ship was moving it circles,up and down and in and out, no flashing lights.  Then a huge light came out of the space ship onto the pink hawian, a hotel.  The light looked like a funel or car show light, it was large cilnder and bright.  The light stayed for about 5 min.  then the light went back up and the craft started it&apos;s weird formations again and then disappered.
19980208	19980303	 Moundsville, WV	 light	20 seconds	Bright, slow-moving, star-like lightOn the date mentioned above, I was observing the night sky with my telescope and a pair of binoculars.  After scannining the sky for a few minutes, I noticed an unusually bright star-like object positioned approximately 40 degrees above the southwest horizon.  I viewed it with my telescope, then with the binoculars.  It then started moving in a northerly direction. After about 5 seconds the light dimmed. It kept travelling north and approximately 15 seconds later, it disappeared.  I know this was not an airplane or helecotper because I have seen them through my binoculars before and they( airplanes and helicopters) move much faster.  There have been reports in the local newspaper by others who witnessed the same thing to call them to discuss this sighting.
19980908	19980924	 Emory (5 Mi East of), TX	 fireball	4 sec	At 45 Degrees in NNW sky. White ball as big as pencil eraser in hand with halo at first. Bright white like sun fading in intensity until dissapeared in NW sky. Very slow movement down, like it was coming almost head on. No tail or sound or smoke. Not an aircraft.I was outside in the country (no background light) looking for shooting stars when I noticed a bright light in the corner of my eye. Turning to the North I was amazed to see the brightest object in a night sky I can remember. The round object was moving very slow, and it was so bright it was lighting the air around it giving it the appearance of a halo. As it decended the halo disappeared and the ball faded out in a linear fashion, keeping its original size as it darkened. I told my wife about it and when I heard the other reports coming in last night 9-23-98 it reminded me of my experience and I thought it might be interesting to others. My background is degree in physics, retired from semiconductor industry and 43 years as a ham radio operator - K5BTV.
19980316	19980318	 Holderness, NH	 fireball	5 sec	Large greenish blue fireball seen almost overhead, travelling in northerly direction.Delivering newspapers in the Mt. Prospect area of Holderness, I glimpsed a large greenish/blue fireball @0315. What surprised me the most was the rate of speed, much slower than a meteorite. This must have been due to being much closer to the earth. In relative size it appeared to be 1/2 the size of the moon. My first encounter with a fireball was on 2/15 @0515 on Rte. 113 in Holderness. This fireball seemed much closer and was white in color. I had never seen a fireball before and was quite astonished at the size and slow rate of speed. It appeared to be very low, almost directly overhead. The following night I glimpsed another at a much greater height.

Then at 7:30 when I help take out the restuarant trash , I notices 3 objects moving flying in perfect straight formation, (they didn&apos;t look like a plane or any normal aircraft). Then I went inside to get trash bags for the cans, my coworker said he saw two planes flying together chasing the 3 objects the 1950ish type planes split up (east to west) , the one plane heading east towards the 2nd ufo in formation zoomed over me and my coworkers head , the planes were flying low. Then all of the sudden the middle ufo stop (like it had breaks) &quot;no plane I know can do this&quot; the other two ufos moved closer to the middle ufo. Then I went inside quick because I had to go back to work.There were 3 objects flying in formation moving due south following the beach at 7:30 . Two planes flying after the 3 objects separated east to west. One of the pilots flying late model war planes flew low over us. The objects were bright like moving stars. In no-way looked like a plane. The 3 objects had get breaking ability, also the ability to fly in perfect formation like a perfect line.

19980403	19980404	 1-25 corridor (southbound, 65 miles north NM border), CO	 disk	30-45 minutes	This event was seen my many-the objects were clear and distinct-and moved independent of each other-if left who all saw this overwhelmedMyself and 6 others were traveling south on I-25, in southern Colorado. We were traveling in 3 seperate vehicles and traveling betwwen 10 -15 minutes apart. We noticed some lights moving strangely in the sky, and as we watched them we were going up a very steep hill on I-25 and as we came to the crest of the hill, and to the point where we could see the valley below, we were presented with a scene that brought us to a stop in the middle of the road.  It was like a scene from a movie,the valley was filled with light and ships-they were at 500-600 feet off the ground.  There were at least 8 vehicles pulled off the road that we had seen, with people standing out and looking up at the craft in the sky.  We were between Rye Colorado and Walsenburg, Colorado. The two main objects were bigger than the other objects, and stayed centralised to the others as the others moved and enteracted with each other, almost as if playing.  They moved in and out of the range-as we were in front of the front range of the Wet mountains. Two helicopters and two fighters approached from the direction of Norad or maybe Ft.Collins. The helicopters and the jets stayed mainly on the perimeter of the objects, which at times were in an area of the sky, of about a mile.  The two main objects were orangest and the smaller ones more yellow. The objects were moving south at a very slow rate and seemed totally unconcerned with the helicopters or the jets.  The smaller objects did manuvers unlike anything we had ever even imagined and the seemed to glow and blink at each other as if enteracting. They moved at times together and then other times apart. We were all so stunned we realised we were holding hands and just asking each other if this was somekind of beginning or maybe and end.
19980412	19980414	 Cleveland, OH	 light	5 min	I was out enjoying the stars (clear night) when suddenly there was a light in the sky, as if the object were a falling star or satelite.  What made it different was its abiliy to change direction. It was moving quickly and had it been a satelite or something, it would go across the horizon in a straight manner.  This moved from due East to a South East direction.  It was very noticable and lasted +/- 10 minutes.43 year old real estate developer w/2 children in private school.
19980130	19980202	 Sedona (5 miles w. of), AZ	 light	5 hrs	Summary : Stationed on a small hilltop situated between the Secret Mountain Range and Mingus Mountain, near the Bradshaw Ranch, six people witness two very strange events: A blinking light of different colors appearing on the horizon, and two solid objects of unknown origin descending to the east.Three researchers of the investigative group &quot;Citizens for U.N. Base Disclosure&quot; planned an all-night long research event on the nights of Jan. 30th and 31st of 1998. In an area known for unusual UFO activity, the researchers set up their equipment on an isolated hilltop near the Bradshaw Ranch (which has been featured on the TV show &quot;Sightings&quot;). One man driving a Jeep Laredo, and a married couple in a Suzuki sport-utility eventually joined our party, and we built a camp fire as we gazed the night skies. The first sighting came at dusk, with a few stars beginning to show up. An object, descending from the east, was spotted. The object was bright white in color, approximately 10,000ft. in altitude, and about three times the size of Venus. It seemed to be a solid object. Adjacent to the object, at an est. distance of 1,000 ft. was a smaller object traveling synchronously with the larger object. We all witnessed these objects travel for about 1 minute, until they disappeared behind 6,500ft. Bear Mountain (3 miles to the east of where we were). The objects were very unusual, and did not look like any conventional aircraft. The second &quot;sighting&quot; was witnessed throughout the night: a bright light flashing numerous colors was seen low on the horizon near Camp Verde, a town about 15 to 20 miles south of our location. The light was quite clear, thus suggesting that it could not have been very far away (maybe 20 miles in distance from us). The light, when first seen, was moving up, and left and right slowly. Then it ABRUPTLY vanished. The light would then reappear in the same location...then it would eventually vanish. This activity went on throughout the night. The light simply was not an airplane due to the bright blinking colors it emitted, what&apos;s more, the light was not located near any known flight path for airplanes or near any known airport. More info on this sighting and other strange events concerning the Sedona area can be found at the following web site: http://users.sedona.net/~redstone/UN-BASE.htm

We stopped, got out to look at it.  Others inn their cars stopped and did the same.  As night came it glowed a shade of red.Nothing came out of the craft.  It must of had some kind of mechanical problem.  And after a couple of hours the craft took off.

19980529	19980603	 Dallas, TX	 disk	6-7 seconds	While inbound on Amer. Airlines Flt. 1409 from Atlanta to Dallas, just north of Dallas, @4,000 feet, I saw a small disk like object 2&apos;x 2&apos;.I am a successful medical diagnostic ultrasound and video endoscopy distributor in Dallas, TX.  On Friday, May 29th at approximately 2:45 pm, I was returning on American Airlines flight 1409 from Atlanta to Dallas.  We landed from the north at DFW.  About 5 - 10 minutes before landing, I was watching attentively out my window when in front of the aircraft, at about the 2:00 position in the sky, I saw a metalic silver and navy blue disc like object.  It was about 2 feet high and 2 feet wide.  It may seem odd that it was disc shaped with these specifications, however, it was almost as if it were segmented.  Imagine a disk about 8 inches with squared off sides sitting on top of another disc about 16 inches wide, sitting on top of another disc about 24 inches wide.  Under the 24 inch wide disk sits another 16 inch disc and under it another 8 inch wide disk.  The top and bottom and each side were symetrical. At first I though it was a bird, but a couple seconds latter in came into clear focus as we flew only about 200 feet away from it.  It was on the right side and roughly the same altitude, about 4,000 feet.  I am familiar with altitude as I have about 20 hours of flight instruction. It was definitely the most uniquely mysterious object I have ever seen, and I can&apos;t think of anything to explain it.  I believe it was either moving slowly or not at all.
19570305	19980406	 Jena, LA	 sphere	15min.	Heading S. in my car on two lane highway entering Jena LA saw UFO&apos;s to the S.E. many cars stopped to abserveThe objects were heading from the South Eeast to the North East at a steady pace there were no turns or gains or losses of altitude they were completely quiet. The speed seemed faster than any aircraft known to me.(I&apos;d just completed an enlistment in the Air Force and was familiar with the then current aircraft) There were three objects and each were three spheres joined two on the bottom and one on top forming a triangle. The color was light blue and seemed to be luminus. There appeared to be a formation two flying paralel and the other flying above the one flying further to the East. These objects were very visable and many cars stopped to abserve, it was a clear night and the highway was lined with people standing outside their cars. The curious thing was that though people talked about the event in a restaurant I stopped at the next day there was no reports on the media. I know this report is very old but thank you for the chance to file it.
19980517	19980518	 Salt Lake City, UT	 triangle	10 sec. 2 times	My father was outside looking at stars, and he came in to get me. He told me that he had seen three lights go across the sky at a very fast speed. While he was telling me all of this, we both saw two more of them go over us. They were going across the sky directly over us from South to North.They seemed to be triangular in shape with a dull white light comming from them. There were 5 of the all together, three the first time, and then two more about 5 minutes later. All five took about 10 seconds to travel from straight overhead, to when they were out of our sight.

19971114	19980422	 Palo, MI	 triangle	ca. 30 min	While outside at a basketball game, several people and I saw ann oject rise straight up and hover then fly, very low, over our heads.During a basketball game at our local school three friends and I decided to get away from the noise and take a walk around the perimeter of the school.Having told them to go ahead, I grabbed my coat and quickly attempted to catch up.as I reached the hill on which the elementary building is located, I slowed, it being a steep hill. Just as I had reached the top of the hill and was leaning against the corner of the building, I happened to look NorthEast and saw a small triangular object rise straight up, out of the trees and hover for several minutes perfectly still. It slowly moved toward me and being rather frightened at this point ran around the end of the building and ran into on of the three friends I was walking with. The friends, also watching the object and I walked back around the way I had come and watched the object pass directly over our heads. No more than 30-40 feet above us we clearly saw that the object had 3 lights, one at each point. One was red, one was green and the third was either blue or white. There was some conflict to the color of the third light. it made no noise other than of the air moving past it. The object was about 10 feet thick. seeing this we all mutually agreed to keep this incident a secret to all except to a close friend of all of us who wasn&apos;t with us. We decided not to go back into the school immeadiatly; but to discuss it on the playground and clear up who would know, what we would tell and also to clear up details of what had happened before I joined them. In discussing this last matter we discovered we all had the same expierence. On walking back to the school we spotted the object hovering over the absent friends home which was visible from our location. The next day, the absent friend reported nothing strange the night before. Since that time One of My friends and I have seen many of the other objects similar to the first. The fore mentioned friend and I share the symptoms of shaking and nausea when reading alien or UFO related materials and both have the feeling that sometimes there is something watching and getting closer.Sometimes we will have these symptoms simultaneusly.
19980422	19980423	 Bangor Submarine Base (Olympic Penninsula), WA	 disk	2 seconds	Entire bottom of disk was glowing except for center circular area approximately 30% of the diameter.  Total diameter approx 100 feet.  Object 300-400 feet off ground moving slowly &amp; silently direclty over Bangor Submarine Base.  Distance from me approx 3/4 mile.The glow on the bottom of disk was totally white... (no colors).  I seemed to be seeing only the bottom of the disk.  Later during same evening (11:15 newscast) on Seattle Television (King 5) there were reports of strange green flashes of light in the sky at 9:15pm to the west of seattle.  This was approximately the same time... yet I saw no flashes ... only the disk.  There was no sound from the disk.  It did appear to be descending slightly as it moved from a Northerly to a South Westerly direction across Bangor Submarine Base.   I was the only observer in my household.  I am 54 years old and a Information Systems analyst with Electronic Data Systems in Poulsbo, and am also a retired  government (U.S. Navy) computer analyst.((NUFORC Note:  This witness is very well known to NUFORC, and we consider him to be an exceptional witness.  Please see other reports about the same incident.  PD))
19980320	19980320	 Kearney, NE	 triangle	aprox 20 sec	Going west to east. No sound.  No lights. Illuninated by city glare. Alt. unknown. Straight overhead.  Width, 2.5 fingers at arms length. (Thickness of fingers).9:46 pm, Mar 20, 1998. I went out side to get something out of my truck and heard Geese flying over.  I was looking up, blocking the house lights so I could see better. Some times when geese fly over at nite in the dark you can spot them in the city lights glare. As I looked somewhat to the west I thought I saw some comming over me going east. But as the lights from town hit IT,  I could make out a perfect triangle. For a few seconds I thought my eyes were playing a trick on me and it was really a flock of geese flying back to roost for the nite. But the harder I Iooked, the more I realized it was a solid shape,  not a &quot;V&quot;.  It looked dark gray or black with only reflected light illuminating it. It continued east untill it was out of the glare of the city.  I continued to watch that direction to see if it blocked out any stars momentairly,  but it didn&apos;t, (that I could tell).  When it was directly overhead, it didn&apos;t pass over any brite stars, to block them out.  I couldn&apos;t tell how high it was but it was 2  1/2 fingers long.  That is, the thickness of my fingers at arms length. There were comercial jets in the area at their crusing alt. but I suspect this UFO was way lower then them because one finger could easily block them out.   Not 2 to 3 like the UFO. This is about all I saw.  Just here a few second...then gone.
19980502	19980514	 Portland, OR	 triangle	3 seconds	It was triangular in shape, but hard to describe, because of so many different angles.Well, it was not my plan to report this, because I have never in my life seen something like this, and figured no one would believe me.  After listining to the Art Bell show last night I figured &quot;why not&quot; so here I am.  I work for a hospital in the Portland area.  I start work at 2300 hrs and usually arrive around 2245 hrs.  On this night I pulled into the parking lot, and began my short walk to the engineering shop where I work.  I am not sure why, but I just happend to glance in the sky, and I saw this object traveling across the sky at an increadiable speed.  It was not real high.  I would say about 500 meters up.  It was solid black with a strange triangular shape with a lot of sharp angeles.  It had no lights on it at all, and made no noise what so ever.  It traveled from the south to the north, and went from my field of view within 3 seconds or so.  It gave me the chills because I know I did not imagine what I just saw.  I was able to see it because there was a heave cloud cover this night, and the city lights put a white glow on the clouds.  When this solid black object came across the sky, it was not hard to miss against the city lit clouds.  This object was fairly big.  I would say about 75 to 150 feet long, so it appeared to me.  If you do happen to call, please call after 1700 hrs.  I wake up at 1630 hrs each day.
19780301	19980423	 Los Gatos, CA	 oval	1 min / approx.	Large elipsoid object (greenish hugh) hovering and slowly moving forward just above the treeline (approx. 150 feet) in Los Gatos foothills.I was eleven years old.  Standing on my driveway in the rustic Los Gatos Foothills with my younger brother (9 at the time) and neighbor (16 at the time).  We were talking... then both of their mouths fell open.  I turned to see what was going on.  A large elipsoidal object (about the size of a 1/4 mile running track oval was hovering toward us (very slowly) just above the sycamore trees (approx. 150 feet).  We all stood in silence and awe for a minute as the object moved almost directly over head. I ran into my house to get a camera.  Here&apos;s where it gets weird... .  I asked my mother for a camera (we had two olk kodak&apos;s in a drawer) and she forgot where they were (my mother knows exactly where everything is in her house, she&apos;s meticulous like that)  I went to the drawer where the cameras were and pulled one out.  My mother stopped me saying she didn&apos;t know if it had film in it.  I thought it did and took it and ran through the house to go outside.  (It gets weirder now)  I ran through the television room where my father was watching a rerun of Gilligan&apos;s Island (he never watches the show, doesn&apos;t like it much, BUT it was MY FAVORITE SHOW)  I had the thought that the object/UFO was now gone and sat down to watch the show (which I had seen many times before).  When the show ended... I saw that I had a camera in my hand and couldn&apos;t figure out why.  I thought hard and knew that there was something &quot;really important&quot; that I was forgetting.  I remembered the UFO and a wave of terror came over me.  I ran outside to see if it was still there. I found my younger brother and neighbor exactly where I had left them.  Only now they had been joined by two other neighborhood kids (I believe 18 and 19 years old at that time).  The UFO was no longer there.  I asked where it went.  They asked &quot;where did what go?&quot;  I said, &quot;The UFO, where did it go?&quot;.  They said &quot;oh, that, it took off real fast, but that was a while ago&quot; (all four of them saw it leave). I find it odd that they shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. A few years later I was with my mother in a local shopping mall.  I went into a bookstore to find her.  The book &quot;Communion&quot; had just come out and wsa displayed in the store.  I literally was scared for my life when I saw the cover... I was terrified that the alien on the cover was going to kill me.  Now, I&apos;d never seen a picture of a Grey up to that point in my life.  And I had no idea that it was an alien.  Non-the-less, I ran out of the bookstore and sat outside for 1/2 an hour scared to go back in and see the image of the alien. Was I abducted?  I don&apos;t know. All I know is I saw that UFO (or at least something without wings or propellers)  when I was a kid.  And I was terrified of the picture on a book cover.
19970327	19980610	 Carlisle, PA	 formation		This is an investigative report of this sighting report from your webpage. Carlisle PA sighting of a formation of lights - 3/27/97 I have investigated several similar reports from the Carlisle area.  There  is a club of ultra-light plane pilots operating from a small airport nearby. They like to play UFO games, and also fly formations.  The fact that the lights reponded when the witnesses flashed a flashlight is a sure giveaway.  Also, this sighting was near twilight.  Ultralights pilots are not licensed.  They are not supposed to fly after dark, but have lights for twilight.  They use Visual Flight Rules and almost never fly flight plans because they return to the same field from which they took off.  They are too small and fly too slowly to appear on radar screens, if at a distance are noiseless (or if the wind blows the wrong way) and may seem to hover, particularly if flying into a headwind.  I have been told by a member of this club that &quot;If you want to see a real UFO, you should see us turn our spots on and fly IN A CIRCLE,&quot;  and he roared with laughter. How to identify possible ultralight formations: 1) the &quot;leader&quot; effect, wherein the lead plane (as with birds) moves around, but the others seem to be steady because they have someone to guide on. 2) unequal number of lights on each wing of a VEE (even number of lights or planes) 3) seen in twilight (although illegal after dark flights are sometimes made) 4) motor noises (but only if very close) 5) usually no motor noses, particularly if at a distance 5) slow or hovering 6) respond to lights or signals from the ground. Investigators should seek out local flying fields on a nice Saturday and make friends with pilots.  They are good sources of info, but be careful you don&apos;t give them any ideas. Conclusions: These sightingswere most likely ultralights. PS: I once spoke to an ultralight pilot who told me that in the ealry 1980s he belonged to a flying club which operated out of the airport at Stormville NY.  They even called themselves &quot;the Martians&quot;.  He said a pix of their formation once made the New York Times.  A 1984 investigative article in Discovery magazine concluded that they were small planes.  He said that the small plane pilots also also tried UFO hijinks, with spots and Christmas lights, etc., but he said the &quot;real Martains&quot; were the ultralights.  They stopped doing it after literally thousands of commuters were stopping on roads and they were afraid they would be heldl responsible for traffic accidents.  These were the stimuli for the &quot;&quot;Hudson Valley UFOs&quot;.  Of course, once people started looking up, they saw UFOs everywhere. There is an incredible amount of air traffic in the NY metro area. Delgado and Hynek&apos;s book &quot;Night Seige&quot; dismissed the Discovery explanation with only a couple paragraphs, yet included sightings with &quot;UFO motor noises&quot;, no radar contacts, &quot;hovering&quot; etc. This book can&apos;t be taken seriously because of its dismissal, withouht much discussion, of the Discovery investigation. My acquaintance related this story to me and then roared with laughter, &quot;Now everybody&apos;s doing it&quot;, he told me.

19741115	19980318	 Val Caron (Canada), ON	 cylinder	10 mins	The craft first caught my attention by it&apos;s size and lack of noise since the Sudbury airport is so near.The object appeared to constructed in segments along it&apos;s length(130&apos; approx).It&apos;s shape was odd in that though cylindrical it&apos;s ends were well like the ends of a bean.I was only a 1/4 mile away as it overflew Hwy 69 heading north @ 400&apos;alt 40-60kph.It ever so slowly stopped dead, pivoted directly east and proceeded directly to the radar domes @ CAFB Falconbrige in plain sight which was part of the Pinetree line(NORAD) in those days.Somethings you never forget like just how casual this thing behaved.Not long after it was&apos;nt visable anymore a CP airliner 4 engine turboprop came just a howling along the exact flightpath of that...that whatever it was.I&apos;ll never forget what I saw in the afternoon sun.WOW.The overall dimensions 130&apos;long 35&apos;wide 30&apos;high.The construction appeared to be 9 or 10 segments of a stainless or aluminum material as it refected the sun which was on my left while the craft was on my right.No doors or openings,no lights or appendeges,no noise.It&apos;s flight was at a constant slow speed throughout the event.When it stopped and turned it happened very slowly approx 20-30 secs with no change in altitude.I was the observer and  was 14yrs old.I had my first helocopter ride when I was 3yrs and had flown in many aircraft in fact I had spent that summer working at a fly in fishing camp.You Know it depresses the the Hell out me that the goverment isn&apos;t more forthwright.If a little guy like me Knows..... whats the problem.I&apos;m presently a member of the CAF
19890709	19980327	 Beardstown, IL	 circle	1hr	seen 2 gold circular shaped lights in northeast  region of sky.  The first light slowly    dimmed out, and then a second gold light just higher than the first lit up.  Then it slowly dimmed out.  after four or five minutes, I seen 4 more lights in the northwest part of the sky lighting up and then slowly dimming out, at one  point all four were lit up at the same time.  After maybe 15min, i seen 4 more lights in the northeast region of the sky, doing the same.objects were circular in shape with a gold or bright yellow  color.  The lights were all lined up in a row. I could&apos;nt see any movement, only that they would slowly dim to nothing.   I never seen them in the ne or nw region of the sky at the same time.  The lights were lined up fairly close together, to close to be a plane.

19980517	19980517	 Almont, MI	 circle	15 sec	We saw a torroid shaped object moving due south at a high rate of speed.i was sitting on the front porch (facing due north) at 5:00pm (EST). I was speaking with my wife and sister-in-law when i noticed an object crossing the sky from West to East in a straight line.  The object was torroidal in shape with half of the radius (outer) in white and appeared luminescent.  The inner section was dark shaded fading to black in the exact center. When i initially spotted the object, (it was at an elevation of aprox. 45 degrees and with an extended arm, would be the size of a dime held between the thumb and index finger) i exclaimed &quot;What is that!&quot;; i rose from the step, and advanced towards the driveway (North) to maintain my view.  My sister-in-law was able to capture a glimpse before it vanished behind the trees to the East of the house.  We scurried to the side yard (East of the house) where there is a fairly open field next to us.  It did not appear again. The field of view during the event was about 60 degrees incl. Skies are perfectly clear.  Wind is out of the WNW at 9 mph. Temp is 82 degrees.  Humidity is 35%.  Dewpoint is 54 degrees. Visibility 10 mi.  Ceiling unlimited.  (data from Weather channel). I will send a map and detail drawing via e-mail.
19930704	19980613	 Tooele City, UT	 sphere	90 seconds	4 intense glowing green &quot;Stop-light&quot; type orbs holding tight diamond formation.  Not Fireworks...4 intense glowing green &quot;Stop-light&quot; type orbs holding tight diamond formation.  I just left home on my way to driving 35 miles to SLC to a radio station(I was a late night DJ and needed to be there by 12:30 am).  When driving eastbound on south end of town, I spotted the 4 described orbs hovering maybe 1000 feet over the Oquirrh mountains (approximately directly over Kennecott Open Mine Copper Pit).  I pulled the car over and assured myself I wasn&apos;t seeing a reflection on the inside of my window.  (I moved to various areas of the window, and also rolled down my window and looked outside, the orbs remained stationary).  Even though this was 4th of July, these were definitely not fireworks, as the tight formation hovering continued for somewhat over a minute.  Then the orbs flew in tight formation in a very horizontal direction to the north, following the mountain range.  Apparently the orbs were either in the mountains or in the Salt Lake Valley, because as they flew northward at an extreme speed, they dissapeared behind the mountain range.  I am unaware of any reports on this, but I was on my way to a radio station and broadcasted my sighting on-air and requested further reports to be called in.  I didn&apos;t receive any comments, so I may have been the only one who saw this.
19970704	19980206	 Crestwood (near St. Louis), MO	 light	15-20 seconds	My wife and I were on our deck watching the fireworks display at Webster Groves Recreation Center, about a mile from our location. A bright light shot across the sky and lit up our entire back yard. It was going from east to west.                    A brilliant white light appeared from the east, traveling in a westerly direction. It turned the whole area bright as day for a few seconds. It did not make any sound. this happened about 9:30 in the evening.
19970513	19980217	 Edinboro, PA	 oval	3-4:00 min	A friend and I had just dropped off another friend in a suburban neighborhood.  My friend was driving, and I was in the passenger seat.  It was a very stary night, and the sky was completely clear.  We were coming upon an intersection where I saw a red, glowing object hovering over a corn field in back of a house across the street, in the left corner of the intersection.  I alerted my friend to its presense, where upon he accelerated in order to get a closer look.  As we neared the intersection the object began to move parallel to the road that we were traveling on.  I had my head out of the window.  The object seemed to be silent.  It maintaned a steady altitude of maybe 300-500 feet.  It then crossed the road in front of us, while gaining altitude, and then traveled off in what appeared to be a southwesterly direction.It was difficult for my friend and I do accurately estimate the distance between the object and the ground when we first observed it hovering.  It was oval or egg-shaped and glowed red. It seemed to emit an aura of sorts.  When I think back to this experience, due to the behavior of the object and the apparent absence human activity, I do feel as if we had surprised the object when we came upon it.  When it did cross in front of my friend&apos;s vehicle and continued to ascend into the atmosphere I believe that it did so to a certain point at which it stopped and once again hovered.  Because I followed its path with my eyes, I could see its ascension, but eventually the light ceased to move.  At this point I observed that the object did not appear to change in size, as it would if it were continually moving away from my point of observation.  In addition, the intensity of the red light it emitted did not change as it would if it had been moving away in a continuous manner.  At that time it appeared to me as a red light &quot;camoflouged&quot; amongst the spectrum of lights present in the sky.   Although we try to remain skeptical, my friend and I had never before experienced a ufo encounter of this nature.  We are both highly interested in the pursuit of the truth underlying this type of phenomena.
19980424	19980425	 Bedford Park, IL	 fireball	3-5 seconds	A glowing green sphere, with a white rectangular light behind it, emerged and then streaked westwardly.  As it streaked it slightly grew in length.  The next day in Cicero Il., I witnessed the same sphere.  It also streaked westwardly.  Both instances were somewhat like a shooting star.  But was much closer and the streak was wider than one would see with a shooting star.I had just got out of work and was waiting for my brother to pick me up.  I glanced up at the sign on our store front when I noticed a green sphere begining to streak up above.  As it was streaking, it left a white trail behind it that elongated as the green sphere advanced.  Then suddenly the sphere gained velocity and vanished.  Upon gaining speed, the white tail shrank and dissapeared along with it.  I have seen shooting stars before but never like this. I was curious as to what it was.  It appeared not to be in the immediate atmosphere but instead just outside of it.  This occured thursday morning at 12:25.  On friday as, I was walking with a freind, we were talking as I glanced straight ahead and saw the same sphere streak by ahead of us not above us.  Like the first instance, it also headed west and lasted only 3-5 seconds.  This second instance occured at 9:30 p.m. .  I could not believe that I was seeing the same thing I had witnnesed a day earlier.  My reaction was that of amazement and reduced my ability to react.  I only pointed the object out to my freind as it vanished.  Unfortunately he did not see it in time.  I am not suggesting anything grand or spectacular.  I am only reporting what I have witnessed.  I hope to somehow find the answer to this curiosity that has crossed my path twice.

19971231	19980101	 Manassas, VA	 formation	30 sec	Summary : observed a formation of approx fifty craft in upper atmosphere traverse night sky.  formation was traversing sky from west to east and had a diamond like formation at it&apos;s center.Objects in the formation were oval shaped with slight points at their sides.  All were identical and were a light brown or tan in color. The formation did not break as it traversed across the night sky.  I called Andrews AFB and the SDO gave me the # to the FAA which turned out to be a fax #.  I called Wash-DC info and got the # for the FAA which gave me the # for MUFON.  Very interesting...that the govt. does not want anything to do with UFO&apos;s and would rather pass any reports onto a privatley run civilian organization. My fight has only just begun. I will make my sighting known.  I have nothing to lose since I am not a public figure...yet.
19980307	19980308	 Central Florida (Melbourn to West Palm to Orlando), FL	 light	3-5 minutes	Two lights in their own haze.  Very bright one on right moves off and dissapears 30 sec. later other light moves in same directiona and disapears.At around 7pm on 3-7-98 the objects apeared.  They were very bright and you could see the beam of light shining towards the ground. You could see the beam because the objects were both in a type of haze that was only around the light objects.  The haze was not a cloud! The objects were in the eastern sky and it was still light enough to where the clouds were.  All the clouds were to the west.  The light that was on the right was lower then the light on the left.  The objects seemed to be moving to the west very slowly.  They lasted from anywhere around 3 to 5 minutes.  Then the first moved away.  The first objected moved off to the and up to the right.  It was hard to see where it was going because of the haze, and then it disapeared.  The second objected was visable for about another 30 seconds and then it moved off in the same direction as the first object.  No physical object could be seen only the lights could be seen.  I saw this in Melbourne, FL.  People((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))
19950315	19980329	 Danbury  (near; Carmel VOR), CT	 chevron	00:05	Boomerang shaped object approached our aircraft, reamained stationary overhead, and quickly dissapeared in vertical climb until no longer visibleNight sightseeing flight over statue of liberty which departed Waterbury/Oxford airport in Oxford CT. Westbound towards New York class B airspace Hudson River VFR corridor, ident signal from Carmel VOR which was being used for navigation, became very unreadable due to static. I was within Danbury Airport class D airspace, and in contact with their control tower. Directly at twelve O&apos;clock a large boomerang shaped object leaving a trail of what seemed vapor or fog, and a light glow around it approached our aircraft. We were flying a V35  Bonanza, altitude 3000MSL 2400AGL Groundspeed 130knots. No wake turbulence was experienced. Object flying at very slow speed. No navigation/position/anti collision lights. No traffic advisories from air traffic control. As the object positioned itself overhead, some type of observation ports or windows were noticed under the apex or tip of the boomerang. At this point the object made an incredible(as if the whole thing was not incredible enough up to this moment) high rate of speed climb until the object was no longer visible. Name is being withheld for the same reason I did not contact Danbury tower or New York approach to verify if they had seen what I just had. Did not report an incident report for a near miss. My wife who was always skeptical of these things, is now a changed person, and so am I.

19961117	19980204	 Las Vegas, NV	 light	1 to 2 sec.	Saw a stationary &quot;star&quot; all of a sudden zip to the west, across the southwest sky.I was on my patio with my binoculars watching the outbound aircraft from McCarren airport.  I was following one aircraft for a while.  There were two stars that came into view as the aircraft flew into the distance.  All of a sudden the star on the right shot towards the west at an unbelievable speed.   It was as  if it was waiting for the aircraft to pass.  It looked just like a star.  You could not tell if from the billions of stars out that night.   I continued to search for it.  But never found it.  I know it wasn&apos;t a reflection.  I lived out south of town away from most of the lights of the city.
19980922	19980924	 Poway, CA	 cylinder	2 sec	Vertical cylinder, gold and hot, bright light on the bottom.Unlike the one on Sept. 11, this was not reported in the paper the next day. This object was hovering just above the horizon and was a brrilliant gold and was a vertical tube shape. It had a reflective looking bright light on the bottom that seemed to radiate light even though it was not dark out. Unlike the Flash from 9-11, this was not reported and I have found know one who saw what I saw. Thank you.
19980209	19980215	 Holland, MI	 light	seconds	bright flashing lightsmy husband was sitting in a parking lot off m-40 in Holland, Michigan about 4am on the morning of Feb. 9, 1998.  He saw real bright intense white light flashes.  Too bright to see where they came from.  Only lasted a brief second.  Three flashes total.  Can&apos;t remember if it was clear or cloudy skies.  This is the second time he has seen these lights.  We were outside about midnight back in July or August of 1996. Both times it was like someone had a flash bulb, the light is that intense, almost like lightning.  Both times their has not been any thunderstorms or bad weather.  Just wondering what this could possible be.
19940526	19980308	 Sacramento, CA	 triangle	5 min.	A large triangular shaped craft passed over our car while at a stop sign on an empty streetWe were driving to Blockbusters to return a video and took a short-cut onto a fairly empty street. I was gazing out the window, when we came to a stop sign I looked up and saw a large triangle made of a series of lights. The back sections of the craft passed over each other. I looked at the center of it and could (barely) see what resembeld a domb, with a gray tent to it, and on the sides of the craft it appeared to have almost bumper pad shaped structures on it. It slowly passed over us and then vanished after about a 100 feet.
19980913	19980924	 Woodinville (Hyw 9 &amp; 522 jxn.), WA	 light	maybe 3 sec	I was exiting off hwy 522, as I made the left hand turn on to hwy 9. I saw a large white light, with a green tint to it. It had a very long tail white to orange in color. It&apos;s speed was compairable to a slow shooting star. I saw the object just over the tree line, but it was quite a ways in the distance. It shot across the sky like a shooting star or metor, but it did not fade out like one. My whole siting was about three seconds. I stopped and stood on the running board of my S-10 Blazer, but the object was just gone! It traveled in a north to south-west direction. The next day I told my neighbor about this stating &quot;that was the biggest shooting star I have ever seen&quot; As I said in the brief above. I clearly saw at least three colors white, green and a very brite orange. I am 34 years old, a retail manager. I have lived most of my life in and around the Snohomish area.
19910415	19980312	 Scott A.F.B., IL	 triangle	4 min	Observed 1 object moving app. 200 kts., traveling east to west, altitude app. 3000 ft.Only 1 object, triangular in shape, two lights on each corner, moving east to west and traveling at about 200 kts. Because of the time of the observation altitude is only a rough estimate, however at the time I was an Air Traffic Controller in the U.S. Air Force, so it was my job to be able to determine such information by sight, this also means I had radar equipment at my disposal to track airborne aircraft under my control, and at the time of the observation neither myself nor the other two witnesses were able to observe a radar signature of the craft. It appeared to be about 1 mile south of our position in the control tower at Scott A.F.B.. The object made no noise whatsoever.
19710415	19980408	 Burlington, NC	 circle	30 seconds	I was thirteen years old, was in the back seat of a Volkswagon Beetle being driven home from school, while gazing out the rear window I saw a silvery perfect circle approximating the size of the full moon steadily rising upward in the East against an overcast smooth gray sky.  I had a strong feeling not to discuss this sight with anyone, as interesting and astounding to me as it was.While riding home from middle school in the backseat of a Volkswagon Beetle I was gazing out the rear window of the car when I saw a silvery perfectly round object that resembled a full moon rising steadily against a gray overcast sky.  There was no rain occuring, just a dry overcast gray day.  At that time, I was thirteen years old.  I knew that what I saw was not a weather balloon, due to the fact that my father, a small aircraft pilot, had taken me numerous times to the local airport to view weather balloon launches, and I was very familiar with all that weather balloons involve, both visually and mechanically. While watching this object for about thirty seconds, I felt that I was not intended to see it, and I made what I felt was a conscious decision to never discuss what I had seen.  I noticed the object ascending from the East, and I watched it with apprehension until the vehicle in which I was riding turned a corner and went down a hill towards my home, and my view was blocked by landscape and trees..  When I first noticed the silver circle it was about 20 degrees about the visible horizon, when I lost sight of it thirty seconds later it was in what I would consider the 11:00 AM position, but not overhead, still east of me. To the east of my sighting location there was no developments, airports, cities, etc.-- just rural area. The object seemed to be very close in proximity and relatively the size of a full moon, and metallic-- silver in color.  Twenty-seven years later, I can still visualize and feel exactly what I witnessed in 1971, and I still have an eerie feeling when I think about it, whic is mostly all the time.

19980530	19980531	 Woodstock, IL	 cigar	15-20 seconds	I looked up in the sky and  saw a green luminous cigar shaped craft.  Right when I saw it it took off .  A few seconds latr it came back and lit up the entire area.My cousin Chris and I are each 14 years of age.  Lastnight we dissided to sleep outside.  The clouds were out so we really couldnt see the stars .  We were talking about something and I saw a large and bright haze in the corner of my eye.  I looked up and saw a bright greenish object in the sky. I immediatly yelled to my cousin to look up in the sky.  He then saw it and freeked out.  He got up and started to run towards the house.  I was amazed and still was looking at it.  It then shot away and left a green-yellow glow behind.  After i saw it leave i got up and saw it reapper.  Their is a barn close to us and the house and it lit up.  Their were no cars around and this is in a pretty secluded area.  My Cous then screamed.  He said the light was directly on top of him but i was too busy getting my shoes on.  As I was running towards the house all of a sudden it became pitch black and nothing was in the sky.  We remember it being pretty light ouside we could see each other fi! ne and didnt think anything of it.  About 25 minutes before it happened we were setting up a tarp to set our sleeping bags on.  I brought a super high powered flashlight that is used for my fathers boat.  My cousin was flashing it in the sky pointing out different stars that we could see through the clouds.  This might have attracted them who knows.  Throught the whole thing I was amazed at it and perfectly calm.  Next week we are going to sleep out again w/ cameras and if any thing happens i will write back.
19980923	19980924	 Houston, TX	 fireball	2-3 sec.	I saw a fireball fall from the sky.I saw a white fire ball come out of the sky at about an 80 degree angle. The fire ball was about as big as your finger nail with arm extended. This white ball had a tail following it. In the middle of the white ball was blue. Like the color of natural gas burning on your stove. I looked like a shooting star, but was too close to the earth and too big. I live in the northwest part of Houston. I was sitting in my garage, looking south- southwest when I saw it. I didn&apos;t see where it came from, it appeared and fell to the earth very fast. It dissapeared behind the house across the street. I&apos;ve never seen something like that before. I thought it was a plane crash. Nothing on the news untill I heard your director on Art Bell&apos;s radio show last night.
19980923	19980923	 Kent, WA	 oval	2 seconds	Bright fluorescent blue-green object, flying very fast East to West, in Southern sky. No noise. No tail, but very phosphorescent. Called Renton air traffic control tower. Woman on duty had seen object too. Described it as flying across whole Southern horizon, no noise, &quot;glowing&quot;. Wondered if anyone else had seen it, as I was her first caller about it.See summary description.

The UFO was a bright blue floresent light like a sauser shape. Then after it whent off it changed to a floresent green color.story above
19980426	19980427	 Eagan, MN	 light	5 secs	I glanced skyward and saw an object moving extremely quickly across the night sky. It appeared as two points of light, seperated but traveling uniformly. The object materialized, traveled very quickly on a straight path, then disappeared. I confess that the object was quite faint.The object was two points of light, seperated by just a degree or so. The lights appeared white in color and kept a constant level of brightness.  The two points of light were obviously traveling as one unit as they moved across the night sky. I just happened to look upward to admire the night sky when I left a restuaraunt and noticed the object moving on a southeast to northwest path. Within 5 seconds, the object vanished as quickly as it appeared.  The object never came near the horizon. I recently graduated from college with a degree in Sociology.  I took an Astronomy class in college and consider it somewhat of a hobby of mine.  I have seen countless shooting stars and this object was very different from anything I had seen in the night sky before. It traveled way too quickly to be a jet and there was no actual &quot;streak&quot; as is commonly observed with meteors. The intensity of the lights remained constant until it disappeared.
19980124	19980125	 Kaneohe, HI	 triangle	5 hours	Summary : Saw a very large (size of a school bus) bright light wide triangular shape in the sky hovering above a nearby mountain. Then second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that came to a dead stop unlike any aircraft.It was Saturday morning 1/24/98. The time was 5:45am. It was unusual I was up so early (for some unknown reason) after having a long 15 hour work day. I was wide awake so I turned on my television and sat on my couch when I noticed a peculiar bright light in the corner of my eye coming from my kitchen window. I got up from the couch to get a closer look and it did&apos;nt seem to be moving. It was a very large (size of a school bus?) bright light in the sky just hovering above a nearby mountain (apprx.4 miles away). From my distant view the light was clearly shaped like a very wide letter &quot;A&quot;. I immediately told my wife who first thought I was teasing then responding with a jump out of bed after my unsettled behavior. She quickly acknowledged this was definetly no plane, no helicopter and  no weather balloon. We both ran outside to get a closer look. I then called my brother who lives next door, who joined us with his 3 children aged 12,13 &amp; 15. All eyes were totally glued to the sky for a good 2 hours as the craft very slowly ascended. It&apos;s movement was so slow it took the 2 hours for the craft to become just a speck in the sky, at which time it came to a dead stop. It was about 10 minutes later after the craft had stopped that we then were alarmed by a second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that I have never seen before from any aircraft. I had been to air shows before watching such events like Thunderbirds &amp; Blue Angels and is somewhat familiar with jet speed. To better describe the speed at which the second craft was moving is to take your hand and put it on top of your head and fling it forward as fast as you can. By doing this you can experience the same feeling we all had from the second craft. It was the speed from the second craft that  confirmed that the first very slow craft was a genuine UFO. To continue with the second craft maneuvers - after streaking through the sky it came to a dead stop and then also hovered over the same mountain as the first craft di! d. Now we could see both craft within our sight of view. The first in the very very far distant and now the second craft which we could&apos;nt determine it&apos;s simular shape until it had come to a stop atop the mountain. The second craft hovered for about 5 minutes and just disappeared. We did&apos;nt see it streak off or anything; we just could&apos;nt see it anymore. We all just said &quot;where did it go&quot;? The first craft was still just a speck in the sky and just stayed in the now bright sky (getting hard to maintain a constant view in the daylight) by which time our eyes were irritated and we just got tired of looking at it so long. But before I went inside I remebered it&apos;s location in the sky by using some telephone wires to refer to as a guide to where it&apos;s location was. 3 to 4 hours later I went outside and it was still there. Went to work told some fellow co-workers, made some more phone calls in addition to earlier conversations with the police station and a military base (felt foolishly uncomfortable) to see if anyone had reported any sightings to no avail - bought a telescope came home that night 9 hours later and it was still there. Frantically I set up the Celestron scope with a 4 1/2&quot; (114mm) x 910mm accommodated by a 10 &amp; 25mm lense and 1/2 hour later went outside with it where we had a clear view but not a satisfied magnification of it. My wife and I was sure and precise to it&apos;s location but we lost interest after a couple of hours when it would no longer perform for us. As I sit and type this report 42 hours later from that first moment I saw that bright light outside my kitchen window......(pause) I stopped to look at my now frequent favorite spot in the sky between the telephone wires and see what looks like a distant star in our exact location......will it move again? Who knows? You can bet we will keep looking. But, it has been nice to tell our experience to someone after those foolish sounding phone calls. However foolish, to see what we saw was fun and exciting and a  previlege to have had a little disc! overy channel stuff right in our backyard. Thanks for your time - we are your newest fans of your great web site and the job that your doing.....maybe you can reccommend a quality telescope with photographic capabilities. Thanks again!
19980611	19980616	 Lincoln City, OR	 changing	UNKNOWN	Digital camera shots which contain unknown object not seen until photos were downloaded to computer.I was using my Epson PC500 digital camera to take exterior shots of the view from a Bed and Breakfast for a web page.  No objects were observed with my naked eye except for the seagull which appears in photo no. 2.  Photos were transferred to my computer and were being reviewed in Corel PhotoPaint ver. 7 when I noticed the bright white dot on Photo no. 2.  I then reexamined photo no one to see if the object was present there also.  I discovered the object, only this time appearing as a dark spot.  I then increased the resolution from 288 dpi to 1200 dpi and cropped the object.  I then increased the size 300 percent and was surprised to find what I did. The physical shape of the object appeared to change as well as did the color.  The photos were taken approximately 1.5 minutes apart. I am e-mailing both photos 1 and 2 as well as the enlarged cropped object image of both.
19980918	19980923	 Diamond Bar, CA	 oval	1 minute	Green Pulse light seen for the second time in Diamond Bar. Last year the same light went horizonal across the sky. It was traveling faster than a jet. Very fast, but straight. This light just showed up from nothing! It was very bright and green and pulse down slowly down to ground.Green pulse seen in Diamond Bar last Friday night. I did not report it until I heard people in Seattle have seen one. I thought you should know. It is the second green pulse light see in a year over Diamond Bar. The one Friday night at appox. 9:00 showed up very low like 1500 feet in distance. It was stopped in air, and went down toward earth. The area I figure was a hills and cows pasters. It was a green, light that flashed also white, but pulsed more green.
19980404	19980421	 Gardiner, ME	 circle	6-10 minutes	Went straight up and down for 5 minutes and then dissapeared. Later that night my Mom and I saw it agian do the same thing, only this time is hovered and looked like it was either rotating or blinking.It was around 11:30 and we were all watching t.tv. in the living room. I got up to get a drink and looked out the kitchen window and saw an amazingly bright yellow circle hovering about 1,00 feet above the treetops. I thought it was aa star so i went back into the living room and started watching t.v. again.  My brother went to the kitchen and got a drink also and he also saw it and told us to all go there quick. So went over and looked out the window and the yellow object was going striaght up and down.  it did this for 6-10 minutes and then dissapeared. We talked about it for a while and then my Mom&apos;s boyfriend and his son had to go so we went to bed.  About half an hour later I got up and looked out the hall window and there it was doing the same thing.  i went into my Mom&apos;s room and she was satill awake. i told her and we watched to gether for 3-5 minutes, this time though about halfway through it stoped about 10,000 feet off the ground and hovered and we couldn&apos;t tell if it was blinking or rotating. Then it shot down below the trees and then came back up in an arc about 15,00 feet and went horizontaly over to the left of our house and dissapeared.
19980101	19980512	 Graniteville, SC	 disk		I was taking pictures of a full moon and did not see it until the pictures were developed. I don&apos;t know what to do with the picture (it only turned out on one photo)I have a photograph of a streak of light, upon closer inspection there appears to be a disk shaped object. I have no idea of what to make of it, I did not see it when I took the picture. I was simply taking pictures of the sky, the sun had not gone down completely and there was a full moon, there are trees in the photo, the moon, and the streak/disk.I&apos;m not sure of the time of day, or exactly what day it was, other than it occurred this past winter. I have the photo and negatives locked away. I can check on the date when I retrieve them.
19980202	19980206	 Fort Cambell (25 or 30 mi. nw), KY	 light	40min	a series of four lights one below the other . the color of orange(like a light in a parking lot)on rt. I24 at mile marker 67 I noticed an orange light in the sky (like a security light),but it was to high on the horizon to be a ground level light.(this is while i was driving the interstate!)I glanced at the light again and it went out(Just one light)I looked shortly again and while I was watching it reappeared. no big deal Fort Cambell is just up the road 30 mi.probably just choppers on maneuvers using landing lights(see it all the time (but never with orange lights))I looked over again and there was 2 lights ,  looked at the highway looked back again,and there was 3 lights( all bright orange and reflecting against the cloud cover which was very low this night!) As i looked there looked to be something attatching them together like a silver thread or ribbon. and while I watched they one by one went out in the reversed order that they came on(4,3,2,1 bottom to the original(the top))This had my attention now so I began to look for an exit to put my 18 wheeler on (to be safley out of traffic)as I was looking for an exit I noticed that it had completly dissappeared! as I gave this thought the first light reappeared!(miles traveled at this time about7or8(it seemed to be moving or keeping upwith me because it never changed positions in the window ,Just over the passenger mirror)I found an exit to pull my rig over and got out of the truck ,shut off the engine for silence went around the truck and their it was ! 1 light ,shortly followed by another,shortly followed by another!the lights were perfectly round and seemed to cascade from each otherthey seemed to have a thread or silver ribbon(like smoke,only smoke would dissapate,this did not)I noticed that the light was very brillliant and reflected against the low cloud celing.and caused the reflection againt the clouds as that of a strobe light(kind of like a lantern that is hanging from a peg and rocking back and forth on the peg).The lights went out again and I got back in the truck and proceded down the interstate. Then They began to come on back again. ! At this time I thought I would comfirm the siting with others truckers so I got on the c.b. and asked the other trucks to take a look to the west and tell me what they see!. But at the very instant I keyed the mic. the lights dissappeared and this was the end of the sighting(it was like the thing wanted me to notice it but not to allert nobody else(crazy Huh!!)(but there was a car that pulled off the road to observe)before I got off the exit)there was no loud noise that you would associate helicopters with no sound of anything like an engine .

19980312	19980314	 Red River, NM	 cylinder	3 hours	There were 2 extremely bright objects stationary in the sky, side by side for over 2 hours south of Red RiverOur family was vacationing in Red River for spring break 1998. We had heard there were sightings in the area by the locals, so we watched the skies each night of our stay. Nothing at all unusual for the first 3 days. On our last day, I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and looked out the window to the south. It was a very clear night. I saw an extremely bright light in the sky that stood out over all the stars. I looked at it through the binoculars and discovered that it was actually 2 separate lights, side by side. I awoke my son and brother to verify what I saw.  They agreed it was 2 separate lights and absolutely NOT a star or a planet(s). The lights were dazzingly white and stationary. We watched them until the sun rose and finally couln&apos;t see them anymore because of the sun, although they were visible in the early morning daylight hour after all the other stars had faded.
19980429	19980430	 Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic),	 formation	10seconds	group 4-5 dim orange ligths in V formation,fast silent displacement,east-west,looked changed positions at the end of sighting. Seemed at high alt. Before and after were seen a small and a comm planes. Weather clear, crescent moon.Looked like round and at high altitude,4-5 lights,interestingly not brighting as use to be in planes. First seen towards the north at an 45 angle. Called the attention to my wife,who also saw the formation. We are accustomed to the pass of light planes as there is a nearby domestic airport, and too to the characteristics of navegation lights of high flying commercial planes. To her the speed was fast. Also I estimated a change in the position of the lights at the end of the sighting, that was approx.to 45 degrees to northwest. To my observation that could be birds my wife replied that they don&apos;t have lights.
19980227	19980227	 Morganton, NC	 light	1 hour	Large amount of lights on a mountain about tree top levelDriving home from work, these bright lights caught my attention , on this mountain that was about a mile from where I was, I drive home this way every night and I had never seen any lights on this mt. This was a large amount of lights and at first I thought that they was moving around but after stopping my truck and watched for awhile I summed up that the lights wasn&apos;t moving and that they didn&apos;t remind me of car lights for as I watched and moved about looking at this that it was just as bright from any spot that I looked at them where as car lights would be going in one stright direction and if you moved to a different angle and looked at them they would look different( not as bright) but no matter where I moved to and looked at them , other than the trees blocking the view, they was just as bright. After about 10 -15 min. watching this I raced home , about 5 miles from this spot , to get my binoculars, I was in my house about 5-10 min.then raced back to where I was watching this, thinking that it would be gone, but it was still there. In the same spot from what I could tell. I found a spot to pull over and from here with the binoculars I could tell , whatever it was that it was about tree top level and from my viewing spot it was behind some trees , so I tried to move to a different area and couldn&apos;t find a spot to pull over , so here I am in the middle of the road ( in a good spot now , with a break in the trees where it was at) I couldn&apos;t make out what I was seeing other than it was bright and lighting up the top of the mt. and I didn&apos;t see anything under the lights , but I didn&apos;t get long in this new viewing spot due to another car came up and I had to move and at the same time I noticed that I was a hair away from being out of gas and fearing that if it moved that I would follow and run out of gas and taking a chance of going for gas and coming back. Gas was about 2-3 miles away and you guessed it, When I got back it was gone. Went driving around but didn&apos;t see anything else. Came home and called the sheirff&apos;s office to see if they had any calls on this and was told no. And tried to sum up what I had seen. The best that I can sum up is that it looked liked something I had seen from a movie (as in &quot;Fire In The Sky&quot;) where that object was lighting up the woods. It was light lots of bright flood lights in a large circle and lighting up the whole area. No noise, to me this ruled out a plane or hellicopter, while I was looking at this , it wasn&apos;t like looking at headlights, with binoculars you would be able to tell that it was headlights.It wasn&apos;t moving from what I could tell , the lights wasn&apos;t flickering it was just like it was just hanging there. It was a clear night, you could see stars but then a couple of hours later we had bad fog roll in. I was looking north, but I&apos;m sure I wasn&apos;t looking at a star or airplane for this light was on that mountain. I know that that I shouldn&apos;t had left but I kept thinking that it would still be there when I got back just to find out that I was watching a new house with alot of flood lights around it but that&apos;s not the case cause it was gone when I got back.

19980307	19980313	 Orlando, FL	 sphere	2 minutes	We observed two sperical objects which were bright white surrounded by a haze which hovered in the eastern sky and then suddenly disappeared.We were driving south on Semoran Blvd. near the airport in Orlando when we turned east toward a restaurant. In the eastern sky, at approx. 40 degrees above the horizon, there were two spherical objects emitting a bright white light.  The objects were clearly defined with a haze surrounding them.  The closest analogy I can think of is the appearance of a flashlight in fog.  The sky was generally clear and the airplanes preparing for landing were clearly distinguishable. The airplane lights did not exhibit this same haze so I don&apos;t think the haze surrounding the spheres was the result of any cloud cover.  The two objects were hovering near each other but at slightly different elevations.  The sphere to the left was slightly elevated over the right sphere.  We slowed down to watch the objects, initially assuming that it was some unannounced launch from KSC.  However, the objects didn&apos;t move. They appeared to hover in the same position.  This period was long enough for us to observe them and conjecture as to what we were seeing.  The two objects disappeared suddenly.  When we got to the restaurant parking lot, several other people were standing around discussing what we had just seen. Orlando news covered the reports and showed video taken in Ft. Myers.  This video is an accurate representation of what we saw in Orlando.  Local news also reported that Patrick Air Force Base released a statement that the objects were the result of &quot;naval operations&quot;.  They gave no further expanation.((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))
19961208	19971231	 Jonesburg, MO	 light	10 minutes	Summary : My wife and I were driving up Hwy. I-70 on our way back from St.Louis. Half way home, (around Warrenton) we spotted a strange white light in the sky directly over the highway. As we drove closer, we could see the bottom of the light. It had four triangles on the bottom. The craft then started to move slowly to the west after we passed. 2 miles further, we seen all kinds of activity in the sky. A strange small, red ball bounced up and down and went up the highway about 100&apos; in the air. This, I was told, was an &quot;electronic eye&quot;My wife and I were driving up highway I-70 on our way back from St.Louis about 12:05 PM on Dec. 8th 1996. Around Warrenton, or Jonesburg, Mo, we spotted a very bright white light above the highway. Just hoovering above an overpass about 1000&apos;. As we drove under it, I could make out 4 little triangles on the bottom. The object started to move after we passed. Latter on down the road, we seen a red (electronic eye as I call it) bobbing up and down going up the highway.   That about sums up that story. My family has seen NUMBERS of ufo&apos;s since 1950. My mother seen a disk in the middle of an intersection in Tx in 1950. She was almost blinded by the light. I&apos;ve seen so many, I don&apos;t have time to write it all down. I&apos;ve seen crop circles in our field, I&apos;ve seen ufo&apos;s more than once. No one can tell me that rocket boosters bob up and down and form formations in the sky! Hope this matches up with someone else&apos;s story. Thanks for listening.
19840216	19980301	 Guadalajara, Jalisco (Mexico),	 formation	20 min	it happend while on a road to guadalajara jalisco mexico my 3 brothers ans sister are witnesses of seeing 5 objects flying very high in the sky and it seemed as if they were playing tag or something.It was 1984 arround 11:00pm and my family of 6 including an uncle were traveling from a town in jalisco mexico called TEOCALTICHE. in a pickup truck we were with blankets it was cold. I was looking at the sky because it was so clear out on the road. Then I saw a light moving very high in the sky and I observed it for a few moments then it splitt into 5 lights about the same size or so they started going in circles following each other and speeding very fast away from the formation then returing back and doing it over and over again,by this time my brothers were trying fo find them I was pionting my finger at the objects and they could not find them untill one by one of my brothers found them and we were all going did you see what it did what are they is it a military thing but no it cant be because these things were playing I am lucky to have experienced this fenomena if indeed thats what it was. but I will not forget the exicitement it caused us all the objects only looked like blue in color and some times redish after 10 min of this going on the objects went in different locations. If I continued looking one or two objects played and left I just got tierd of looking it was great.
19980403	19980404	 UK/Northern Ireland,	 changing	unknown	Bright light. Noises. Faces (oval) . Operation. Scars.Me and my mates were walking through a wooded area when I noticed a light in the sky. We looked up and saw the ship in the sky. It changed from an oval shape to a disc shape before our eyes. There was a bright flash of light and i found myself in the spacecraft. I noticed a few oval shaped heads surrounding me. I was momentarily stunned and could&apos;nt move. When I woke up I was on a cold bench. The &apos;beings&apos; were operating on me and i have the scars to prove it. There was another flash of light and me and my mates retourned to the exact same spot that had left only we were left back 3 hours earlier!? I still have flash backs to this day.
19980127	19980127	 Miami, FL	 light	20 sec.	Summary : As I walked into the backyard of my house in Miami, I noticed a sort of amber /white light moving in the sky.During the President&apos;s State of the Union address, My dog asked me to let him into the backyard so he could do his thing. As I walked into the backyard, I noticed an odd looking light in the Western sky. The light was amber/white in color, and was not blinking. It was located approximately 35-40 degrees above the horizon, and moving in a Southerly direction. I watched the object traverse the sky from due West to approximately W/SW. I was watching the light pretty intensely, and all of a sudden, it vanished. The color of the light reminded me of the color and quality of a vapor street lamp. You know, the kind that is supposed to reduce shadows. It appeared to be moving fairly fast. I have seen many airliners flying in the skies around here, and the object appeared to be moving faster than they normally do. It appeared to be out over the Everglades.
19660326	19980503	 Auburn, WA	 cigar	1 minute	I witnessed a cigar-shaped object being &quot;chased&quot; by a military jet aircraft at dusk.At dusk, I saw a whitish cigar-shaped object west of Auburn, at about 20 degrees above the horizon, moving very rapidly south to north. About 30 seconds into the event, I then saw a military jet fighter approach from north to south (and it appeared much closer than the object),  25 degrees above the horizon, make a sharp turnaround  and head towards the object. An afterburner &quot;puff&quot; of smoke was seen that remained in the clear sky for sometime afterwards. The unknown object was fairly sharply defined and appeared to be reflecting the (setted) sunlight, and I saw no condensation trail.  I saw the object by naked eye and through 7x35 binoculars. I admit I was looking for UFOs at the time. Many had been reported in the area. I was inside looking through a window pane.

In June of 1967 while waiting in our car to get into a drive-in movie a saucer shaped craft hovered between us and the Wasatch Mountains.In June of 1967 myself my sister and my mother and father were in our car in line to get into a drive-in movie. We saw a saucer metalic in color hovering between us and the Wasatch Mountains. It was approx. three blocks away and was approx. 100ft. from the ground. It hovered completely still in the air for 20 or 30 seconds. Then it went north still quite close to the ground and below the horizon along the Wasatch front and was out of sight in a split second.  It returned from the north along the same path and was out of sight in the south in a split second. Everybody waiting in thier cars at the drive-in (Woodland Drive-in Salt Lake City, Utah) saw it too. It was very close and we all saw it clearly.  My other sister and a freind of hers were sitting on the front porch of our home in Kearns, Utah at this time and also saw it. From our front yard the whole Salt lake valley can be seen to the east. I have been told that over 200 people reported this sighting.

19880701	19980201	 Arcadia, CA	 rectangle	about 5 minutes	Summary : Our dog was barking at something.  His bark was the bark as if he didn&apos;t want to leave the porch but wanted to summon someone in the family.  I went to investigate. Initially I saw nothing.  Then a rectangular craft flew by very slowly. The craft was divided into thirds.  Each third lit up sequentially with a red light.  The object made  no noise whatsover.In addition to the above information there is more to add that is very interesting.  One week later a friend of mine from high school, telephoned me in a panicked state.  Apparently he had seen the same object in the city of Sierra Madre, while on a night hike into Bailey Canyon.  He had stopped to tie his shoe lace while the others continued on the hike.  He stated that the object appeared to lose control and looked as though it were going to crash into the property of Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center.  This is a Catholic retreat center run by the Passionist Fathers. The thing that through us for a loop about this is this.... My friend who had witnessed this event, a week after I had, had gone to the whole life expo in Pasadena,Ca. of that year.  He left the convention being &quot;paranoid&quot; of ufo&apos;s and aliens.  I was a &quot;doubting Thomas&quot;.  I suggested that he go and see a psychiatrist.  Nothing more was said about the ufo subject untill the sightings that we  had It was that we had conversed, and realized that we had seen the same craft at two different places and times that there must be connection.  It was almost like as if some intelligence did something to get my dog to bark that night, to get me out of bed to investigate so that I would see this craft. Like I said...I never went to the whole life expo....but It was like as if some intellegent being heard me tell my friend Tony that I thought he was a quack.  And to make it even more believable to us it revealed itself to us...that well we never had many people believe our story except one of the priests at the retreat center with whom we were friends with.I didn&apos;t think it necessary to record the dates of the sightings, I didn&apos;t anyone  would believe us. So there you are.  I am a firm believer after having this experience with the object and I feel  ....almost on a psychic level that we are on the verge of something....a revealing of some sort...I cant  really describe it, but we are on the verge of something.
19980308	19980407	 Wichita, KS	 cylinder	3 minutes	On lunch break, heading east in car. Stopped at light, saw object in distance above the horizon. An airliner was heading south, away from it.I was finishing up my lunch break, heading east on Central Ave. While stopped at the light at Central (which goes east/west) and Rock Road (north/south) I spotted an object. This object appeared to be shaped more like an oil barrel, with a flashing red light on the top. An airliner was heading south, away from it. The object appeared to be hovering, but was moving southernly. It was hard to determine the distance from the object to the ground, and to the other objects (i.e. myself and the plane). Note also that at Central and Webb (the next major intersectiion going east)lies Raytheon Aircraft. This object did not appear to be a plane or a helicopter. I was also parked at this light for about three minutes along with about twenty others. I must have looked pretty strange sticking my head out of my car window looking at this thing. The road going east (Central) goes up a hill at this point. There is also a crosswalk midway between Central and Rock, and Central and Webb. This object was not a crosswalk light. While I was observng object move southernly, object passed behind trees. After the light changed, I headed east. Object had disappeared. Plane was also out of sight.
19560601	19980205	 Belton, MO	 other	10min.	THE EVENT WAS A PERSONAL CONTACT WITH AN ALIEN. SINCE I WAS ABOUT 6 YEARS OLD AND IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME FORGIVE ME ANY DESCREPANCIES I MAY HAVE IN MY DESCRIPTION. THE &apos;ALIEN&apos; WAS ABOUT 6&apos; TO 6&apos;5&quot;TALL. IT WAS FORMED AS A HUMAN BEING BUT WITH NO FLESHY APPEARANCE. I.E.,THERE WAS A GLOWING LIGHT AROUND ITS WHOLE BODY. I COULD SEE LEGS, ARM, HEAD, AND BODY BUT BECAUSE OF THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT AROUND THE BODY I COULD SEE NO CLOTHING AS  SUCH. HOWEVER, THE LIGHT WAS BRILLIANT BLUE (AS A VERY HOT FLAME) BUT IT GLOWED ALL AROUND IT TO BRIGHTEN UP THE NIGHT. I HAD JUST STEPPED OUT TO PUT OUT THE TRASH WHEN I NOTICED THE FIGURE OF THE BEING. IT SEEMED TO BE LOOKING AT A NEIGHBORS BACKPORCH LIGHTBULB; AND THE REASON I BELIEVED IT TO BE SO TALL WAS BECAUSE THE BEINGS HEAD WAS TALLER THAN WHERE THE LIGHT HAS BEEN FIXED ON THE BACK DOOR OF THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE. FOR MANY YEARS I HAD NOT TOLD ANYONE ABOUT THIS SIGHTING UNTIL A FRIEND OF MINE SHOWED ME A PHOTO OF A UFO HE HAD TAKEN FROM 1959(FROM A KODAK) WHICH HAD BEEN HOVERING NEAR HIS HOUSE...HE STILL HAS THE PHOTO AND I WILL BE GLAD TO SAK HIM TO SHARE IT WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU ((Name deleted))PERSONAL CONTACT WITH ALIEN TALL- 6&apos;-6&apos;5&quot; BLUE AND WHITE LIGHT SURROUNDING ITS BODY SHAPED AS A HUMAN BEING COULD NOT IDENTIFY: GENITALIA,MOUTH,TEETH, ETC. ONLY THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF A HUMAN FORM COVERED WITH BRILLIANT LIGHT. I COULD HEAR A VOICE IN MY HEAD HOWEVER AS IF THE BEING WAS TRYING TYO CALM ME FROM FEAR OF IT. I SCREAMED AFTER IT SEEMED TO SAY NOT TO BE AFRAID MY MOTHER CAME TO THE BACKDOOR TO CHECK ON WHAT WAS WRONG BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT HER AND POINTED UP TOWARD THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE THE BEING HAD DISAPPEARED... MAYBE IT WAS A YOUNG CHILDS IMAGINATION FOR FEAR OF THE DARK; BUT THERE IS ONE SURE THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THE ENCOUNTER...

19980309	19980311	 Butte County, CA	 light	20 seconds	A single star-like object moved in straight line, west to east, traversing overhead from horizon begining to horizon ending within 18-20 seconds. Object stopped suddenly on 4-5 occassions for 1-2 seconds intervals and resumed course. Est. speed 25-30,000 mph.   Similar witnessing by 4 Nat&apos;l Guard members of 184th Air Assault while on patrol within 80 miles of this location apx 8-9 weeks early.  Saw 4 similar lights that departed in opposing directions after travelling for some distance in a high speed straight line formation.  Radical high speed 90 degree turn.I was setting up my telescope ( huge 12.5 Meade light bucket ) with 20 year old son-in-law.  Night was especially clear and we were using my wide angle lense for moon viewing.  While I was focused on moon, SIL said, &quot;Hey whats that!&quot;  I turned, followed his pointing and coming overhead was a fast moving object.  It appeared slightly slower than a falling comet, but faster than any jet.  It was a single dot of white light that went in a straight line, but stopped, started and repeated this several times while I wheeled my telescope around to catch a glimps of it.  My SIL kept it in constant view by his naked eye and I aligned the Dobson mount and pointed the scope skyward at the object. It was nearly at the end of the horizon when I believe I caught a glimps of it.  It was only a fraction of a second, but I believe it was longer than it was wide and bright metalic.  No other detail could be determined.  While explaining this to a friend the next day I was advised he was 1 of 4 on patrol at apx 0400 hrs. in foothills about 90 miles away.  All 4 guardsmen observed 4 star-like objects flying high overhead until they shot away in different directions.  The were stunned.  In both cases we believe the object/s was extraordinarely high and there was no noise.  Sorry no other detail, just  the pin point appearance of a distant start moving fast!  Very fast.   FYI:  Beale AFB close by both sightings.  Also I am former pilot.  This was not a comet, strongly doubt it was a satellite, NOT a balloon or aircraft.  Served aboard navy missile tracker.  I know what rockets and sats look like.  Have no idea what this was.  I am not at all interested in having my name linked to some UFO sighting... no thanks, but I will at least share this story for what its worth.  Its 100% true, unembellished fact.  In closing I would not have believed the Guard story if I had not seen this first, even though the witness its extremely credible.  He seemed as astonished as I was.  He was in Nevada county at the time, just above Yuba County! where Beale AFB is located.  Beale is a U-2 base and former SR-71 base.
19980313	19980327	 Seattle, WA	 sphere	3 - 4 minutes	We watched approximately 15 dimly lit white spheres that pulsed brightly together in different colors while slowly rising towards the skyMy girlfriend and I were staying at the Marriott Residence Inn on the evening of March 13th 1998 in the city of Tukwila Washington just south and east of Seattle. At very close to 9:50pm as we were walking around the hotel complex (to get some exercise) we spotted something very strange just north and west and maybe 45 degrees up in the sky from our location. It appeared to be a tight cluster of very dimly lit white spheres that were rising out in the distance (south and maybe west of downtown Seattle near SeaTac Airport). The cluster was slowly rising straight up in the air over a period of about 4 minutes. The entire cluster also pulsed a total of three times within about a minute and a half of first spotting them while they were rising.  Even though the objects were a dimily lit white, they pulsed in very bright colors (mostly red) and at exactly the same time. They were also moving around in their tight cluster in such a way that made the whole of the objects seem to change shape and sort of wave around in the sky. Although it appeared to be just to the east of SeaTac Airport we had been watching most of the airplane activity in the area and this was nothing even comparable to any air activity that I had ever seen in my life! The cluster continued to rise until it climbed up into some higher cloud cover and we couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I&apos;m really curious if any one has ever seen such a site especially in the Seattle area?

IT WAS A WEEK LATER AFTER EASTER.  I WOKE UP BECAUSE MY CAT WAS HISSING AND MEOWING. MY GOLDEN RETRIEVERS WERE BARKING AIMLESSLY AT THE LIGHT RIGHT ABOVE THE HILLS OF PIEDMONT ROAD.  IT WAS HUGE.  THERE WERE NO STARS THAT WERE AROUND 3 OR FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER.  THERE WERE SO MANY BRIGHT YELLOWISH, REDISH, AND ORANGISH COLORS.  THERE WAS NOT MOON, AND NO AIRPLAINS WERE FLYING THAT EARLY IN THE MORNING AT THE SAN JOSE AIRPORT. I GOT FRIGHTENED SO I WOKE MY 12 YEAR OLD BROTHER, KYLE, AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS, HE SAID IT WAS THE MOON YOU ARE LOOKING AT.  WELL, THAT NIGHT WAS A NEW MOON.  WHICH OBVIOUSLY MEANS NO MOON IN SIGHT.  CAN YOU HELP ME EXPLAIN THIS SITUATION? I CAN&apos;T GET IT OUT OF MY MIND NOT KNOWING WHAT IT WAS, OR IF IT IS AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT.  THANK YOU.

Then it blinked out.I came home with a friend from  a basketball game.  We were talking and notices something in the sky So we got our binoculars out and watched the object.  It made no sounds, it just hovered their. It had red,white, and blue blinking lights.  The lights moved around the outer edge of the object. We observed it for about  five minutes moving north, then east.  It quickly changed it directions. Into about two minutes of watching it, it blinked out.  But we could still make out an object, &quot;just barely&quot;. Then it re-appeared and continued moving around the mountain again.  Then it blinked out for the last time.

Sky: unlimited,clear visibility.My daughter (14) and I were in the front yard talking.  It was 10:30 pm and the sky was absolutely clear with stars evrywhere.  Suddenly my daughter said &quot;what&apos;s that&quot;. Looking over my shoulder there was an oval light source approx. 30 ft in diameter about 40 - 50 feet above our house. It was not transparent as it blotted out the star field. As soon as both of us were focused on it the object elongated and streaked due north toward Minneapolis (40 mi away). It vanished over the horizon in 2-3 seconds. I served 2 1/2 yrs in the 2d Marine Air Wing and have experience w/aircraft of all types.  This was unknown. At no time did it fall to the earth..but traveled a parallel path w/ the terrain.
19940921	19980312	 Montello, NV	 other	30-40 sec.	A necklace of colored lights against light blue sky, about 800 yards long, moving slowly north.  Blue sky could be seen through the center of the necklace.  Lights disappeared simultaneously.We were returning from a hunting trip, binoculars on the seat, two different vehicles, four people.  When I saw the necklace (I call it the Nevada Necklace), it was about 16 miles across the valley above the mountains between Hoppi Basin and Gamble Canyon, in clear view.  I said, &quot;What is that?&quot; and picked up my binoculars immediately and looked at the object carefully.  It was moving slowly to the north.  After viewing the necklace for several seconds, the multi-colored lights of the object simply turned off or disappeared with no after image.  The object was too high above the mountain to have been able to descend to the mountain or behind it.  I asked my passenger if she had seen it.  She said &quot;Yes.&quot;  The other vehicle containing her husband and son was about three minutes behind us on the same road.  We waited for them.  When they arrived, they confirmed seeing the same object.   In about five minutes we were back in Montello and there were several fighter jets flying all over the valley at that time as it got dark.  I wrote up an incident report and sent it to MUFON but never heard back from them at all.

Straight line travel, no noise.Objects first seen between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, near the Draco constellation. Lights passed directly overhead, no noise. Lights were dim orange, similar to an automobile cigarette lighter&apos;s color. Pattern was first a triangle, then they changed positions, and one went about 1/2 degree away from the others, then rejoined. Lights faded from view, towards Scorpio, didn&apos;t just &quot;wink&quot; out. Initial impression was that the lights were fixed to a larger, dark object, and that the lights were being &quot;strobed&quot; to create impression of moving out of position. Only one observer, visual by eye, no binoculars or telescope. No pictures or video. The sky was clear. I am an amatuer astronomer and familiar with the sky, and my viewing area. I have been in the USAF, and the USN. I am as familiar as most with terrestrial aircraft, and this did not match anything I know of. I&apos;ve never reported anything like this before.

It leveled off and changed to a dome shape with a pulsating red light on top. A white light glowed underneath as it flew level in a NW direction.I am a private pilot (at age 16) with USAF pilot training in T-37 jet. Three of us saw a fire ball enter the atmosphere at a steep angle. It was trailing red fire as it came down at high speed. It leveled off at a few thousand feet and became a dome (lampshade) shape with a pulsating red light on top and a yellowish-white light shining below. It was several miles to the north so we had a side view as it leveled off and slowed way down. It was moving in a westerly direction at approximately two or three thousand feet. It made no sound and the sky was clear and very dark. It got smaller as it flew to- ward the west at several hundred miles per hour. We lost sight after two minutes when it was hidden by the trees on the horizon.

19620715	19980313	 Avon-by-the-Sea, NJ	 changing	5 min	Approached by a small orange light.  Light changed to a large cicular object.During the summer of 1962, my friend and I were at the beach fishing for striped bass.  We had decided to make it an all night fishing trip.  It was a warm summer night and to the best of my knowledge no one else was on the beach.  I was sitting on a beach chair when my friend saw some- thing and yelled, &quot;what&apos;s that&quot;.  I looked up and saw a round rather dull orange light approaching us directly off the ocean. My initial thought was a lost fishing boat using a rather large spotlight to find its way.  It was an odd sight but at the time seemed to be a plasible explanation.  There was a river inlet close by which fishing boats used regularly and I was used to seeing boats in the general location, al- though not that close to shore. I would say the light was 50 yards off- shore and maybe 15 feet above the water.  The width was about the same as a large floodlight, the kind you see at movie premiers, maybe a little smaller.  The light was slowly approaching directly at us and I started to become nervous as it appeared the fishing boat was going to run ashore right at our feet.  When the light reached about 25 yards to our front it suddenly commenced to rapidly accelerate.  It was still heading directly at us and I jumped from my chair, ran back a few feet, and turned back around.  I expected to see a fishing boat run up over our position and ground itself.  To my surprise the light was gone but now there was a large circular object to our front at an altitude of maybe 150 feet. The object was lit but I don&apos;t remember any details or the exact size.  It departed to the NW at a steady slow rate of speed. At the time it seemed to be an exciting adventure.  I was 17 years old and my friend 16 and wow we say something spectacular.  As I think back there is something very disturbing about the event. What happened to rapidly approaching orange light?  Why didn&apos;t we see the large circular object until after the orange light disappeared?
19880715	19980528	 Connell, WA	 oval	1:00	glowing oval-shaped aircraft were seen flying at fast speeds and shifting direction and stoping without slowing down periodically troughout the night.My brother and I were sleeping outside in the summer.  I was about 11 years old and my brother 8 or 9 years old.  We watched objects about the size of the moon move in ziz zag paths, stopping without slowing down, and dissapearing throughout the night.  This happened aproximately 8 times.  We were too frightened to move.  It was a clear night with no clouds. This was no aircraft that I have ever seen.  the object was oval in shape, with a solid, yellowish radiance.  My brother and I aare both sane and can still recall the incident as if it was yesterday.

Craft went straight up and out of sight. Jet left and as dark approached 13 crafts played in sky for many hours entering and disappearing into a cigar shaped craft. Hundreds watched and photographed. I was next to the campus cop and heard all the reports coming in on his radio from in and around the area. The local paper reported this event and nothing else that I know of ever happened. It has left many questions over the years. Question ! Has this ever been reported?Saucer craft with rotating lights.
19791010	19980419	 Security, CO	 unknown	30mins.	very low clouds all different colors,search lights were seen shining down out of the clouds on the houses and streets. this event was seen all over the city of colorado springs colorado and was reported on the local news broadcast. never did hear anymore about the event. news media joked about it and everyone was told that it was the araroa boreralis .the clouds approached from the north very slowly,and were very low to the ground,i would say they were about 500 feet from the ground and many different colors, some light pink,light blue,light green,light yellow. the lights we saw come out of the clouds were bright white like search lights.the lights would move in circular motions and were shining on the houses and streets. they would flash off and on and did this for about 30 mins. as i remember there were about 10 of us standing in a group talking about what we were seeing . our whole block on inca drive in security, co. were outside watching this event take place. when the event ended the lights and the clouds vanished rapidly. everyone went back into their homes and turned on the news report to see if there was any reports on the events that had taken place. the news media gave out a report that what everyone was seeing was the araroa boreralis,and they had received alot of reports of people seeing ufos. the news media laughed and said it was because the movie close encounter of the third kind had just been aired on t.v. none of us buy their story . i lived in alaska for 10 years and never did see anything like that looking nlike the araoa boreralis.
19950715	19980308	 Carthage, IL	 light	2 minutes	Light in the sky that moved unusually and flashed.  What I saw lasted approximately 2 minutes and in no way could it have been an aircraft or meteor.I was at a friend&apos;s house in his driveway talking.  I was looking at the sky, toward the north, at around 11:30 pm.  The sky was very clear and I was looking at a group of stars that seemed to be in the shape of the little dipper, but it was neither the big or little dipper.  This grouping of stars was much smaller.  Aproximately 1/10 th the size.  As I was looking at the stars one seemed to just disappear as if sucked into the darkness.  I thought this was funny and Iblinked and kind of shook my head to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things and when I looked up again the place were the star or so I thought was a star was just darkness.  I looked at my friend and said did you see that.  He had not seen this so we started to watch the sky in this area.  Within a minute of seeing the star or whatever it was disappear we both saw a light flash.  The light was kind of an off white color almost like the color of light produce by a house lamp.  This light was in the sky next to where the star/UFO was but the light I noticed when it flashed was quick and concentrated, not like glare you may see coming from a light source.  About a minute later we saw another flash in the same general area and of the same nature as before. This went on for about 3 minutes.  All three flashes were in the same general area according to our location.  Then the flashes stopped. My mind at this point didn&apos;t know what to really make of it at the time but I kept watching to hopefully see something else to make some sense of it.  With in a minute or two  we saw a streek in the sky of the same color light as the flashes but the streek was moving in an S-shaped pattern.  I drove home that night scared out of my whits and a little excited.  There was no aircraft in the area and nothing unusual about the night except for the light.  The light was farther away as in out of the atmoshere of the earth or right at the edge of the atmoshere.  Up until a few months ago I never really thought much of it other than I couldn&apos;t explain it.  I was watch a ! documentory on U.F.O.&apos;s and they showed one that took on this S-shaped pattern and one that seemed to become longer and then shorted as it moved.  Which if something moved in an S-shaped pattern, if seen from the right angle it would appear get shorter and longer as it moved.  I would appreciate a response and if possible some more information on how to get reports of recent sightings around the nation.
19980305	19980306	 Spanish Fork, UT	 triangle	15 minutes	the craft hovered above a neighbors house about 150ft up then began to move away until it got about 2 miles and then hovered again for another 10 minutes, then took of into a cloud.I was coming home from work, I looked up and saw a dark object. At first I thought it was a black kite, but as I continued to look at it I could see two or three revolving objects that revolved above it and realized that it was some kind of machine. I was driving south and the object was to my right (west) about 150 feet in the air, hovering silently.  I hurried home and told my family, my wife and 2 of our children witnessed it, by this time the object had moved further away(south west), we took turns looking through binoculars. My wife thought it looked like colored balloons revolving around the top of the object. We called the police department and no one else had seen it at that time.  It was a triangular shape at the bottom, maybe about 20 to 25 feet in diameter, but it&apos;s shape almost seemed to fluxuate, with rotating objects above it. It was not floating in the air current, it was definately intelligently controlled. After about 10 minutes it darted off north west into a cloud and with in 2 minutes a jet came out of the cloud close to where it had been.
19681210	19980322	 Abbeville (Lake Secession), SC	 disk	5 min	I had a close incounter with a UFO/(saucer/disc).  Craft hoovered about ten feet over my head, backed off, lowered to eye level, then raised and hoovered over head again.It was about 12:30am, Lake Secession, in Abbeville, SC.  This event occurred aprox. a quarter of a mile from a hydro-electric dam.  I was alone when I noticed a whirring/whining dynamo type of sound outside.  I saw an amber colored flashing light reflecting on the trees outside.  When I walked out the door, overhead I saw a flying saucer (saucer/disc about 35 feet across and about 10 feet in height) hoovering above me no more than ten feet.  There were four sets of lights (each set had three rotating amber lights) which bathed the area in amber.  The outter skin of the ship was what appeared to be a silvery/shiney metalic color.  I recall being terrorfied beyond description to the point where I could not move.  (the house I was in was one of those lake houses that was on &quot;stilts&quot; where the outside deck was about 8 feet off the ground.  Also the lake house had twelve sides and would look circular from the air)  After hoovering overhead, the craft backed away some twenty (20) feet and lowered to where it would be almost eye level with me.  This craft was a saucer shape with a smaller dome on top.  The top dome had a round porthole (window) that was opaque/translucent and I could see that there was a white, low intensity light inside.  Due to the type of opaque/translucent characteristic of the porthole...I could not see if there was anything inside; however, I &quot;knew&quot; that something was in there and it was looking at me.  The craft then raised up, came forward directly over head and hoovered.  This event lasted approximately 5 minutes; although, there are gaps in my memory as to what exactly happened.  The craft then sped off effortlessly about 200 yards and hoovered momentarily over the Lake.  Then it sped off at a 45 degree angle towards the southwest at such a speed that I could not even begin to estimate, until it vanished from my sight into space.  That evening it was a crisp, winter night and the sky was clear giving me an excellent unobstructed view of the craft and the sky as it was departing. As far as my background.  At the time, I was 17.  I&apos;m a white male.  I currently am college educated with a degree in General Business.  I am also a Vietnam Veteran and spent about 3 years on a US Naval Destroyer and have put in many hours as lookout while at sea.  I have been trained to spot and identify various types of aircraft and missiles.  This craft was not identifiable to any aircraft in existense in the United States or any other country&apos;s millitary or civilian air force. I&apos;ve always had the feeling that there was something else that happened that night.  I have a gap in my memory as to all of the events that occurred that night.  I wish that there was someone that I could talk with about this.((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))Change discription of noise....I need to make a change to my earlier report that I sent in.I just entered a report last night....please change the sound that the UFO made.  I had originally typed in it made a Whirring/whining sound.  It was a whirring/whooshing noise. Also...several years later...I had bumped into a fried that I had known for a very long time and after years of not seeing him.  He asked me &quot;whatever happened with that UFO that you saw?&quot;  I didn&apos;t recall telling him about that and asked him what he meant by that.  He told me that I had called him while the UFO was there...while it was over the house.  The reason that I said that I have gaps in my memory abouth this encounter was that I never recalled being on the phone with him and telling him about the UFO being there.  This more or less collaborates in a way, that this was happening.  Also....an addition to my background I have had many years experience as a radio announcer and radio news reporter.  At the time of this encounter...I had already had about 2 years experience in broadcast news gathering...so some of the details that I give are as specific as possible. I hope that you will make the changes in my original report that I sent in earlier.  Thank you.....again.  ((Name deleted))
19980126	19980308	 Coconut Creek, FL	 circle	1 minute	I SAW&nbsp;A GLOWING ORB OF LIGHT FLOAT OVER AN AREA OF TREES. IT FLOATED THEN SPED OFF AT A HIGH RATE&nbsp;OF SPEED TOWARDS THE NORTHTHE OBJECT WAS FAIRLY CLOSE TO ME ABOUT 500 FT IN THE AIR. IT STAYED ABOVE A TREE LINE THEN SPED OFF TO THE NORTH. I ALONE WITNESSED IT AS I WAS WALKING TOWARDS A CANAL TO FISH. IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE AND EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND GLOWING. I AM AN AVID ATRONOMY BUFF AND I KNOW ALL THE STARS POSITIONS AROUND THE YEAR. IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN A STAR AT NIGHT AND IT WAS STILL LIGHT OUT. I HAVE NO EXPALANTION FOR THE OBJECT EXCEPT FOR WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED. I HAD A PHONE CALL A WEEK LATER FROM A MAN IN MIAMI WHO DESCRIBED THE SAME THING HE SAW IN MIAMI ABOUT A WEEK LATER. WHO KNOWS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
19961020	19980215	 Wichita/Rose Hill, KS	 light	15 Minutes	While driving observed 3 parallel bright red lights lighting in turn from left to right. These covered sizable area of night sky. Smaller red lights came out of one end of lights then disappeared. Soon after I witnessed white, clustered, oscillating lights and a separate set of multi-colored lights that formed a line parallel to the horizon. This line sank out of view, but the white, oscillating lights continued to sparkle and dissipate once every 5-10 seconds for approximately 30 seconds.  I continued monitoring sky but saw nothing else.  There were numerous reports of strange lights in the sky that night, from Winfield to Wichita.At approximately 6:20 P.M. on October 30th, 1996 , I was driving east on 47th St. South out of Wichita Kansas.  When I got to about 2 miles west of Rose Hill Rd. I noticed 3 bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They were lighting up, one at a time from right to left.  They formed a parallel line to the horizon and covered a sizable section of the night sky.  They lit up from right to left 5 to 6 times which took about 25 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling red lights just to the right of the furthest southern light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued monitoring that section of sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 5 miles straight east of Rose Hill.  I got out of my car and then noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a multi-colored line of lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approxiamelty 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About 2 seconds later I observed more bright white, clusterered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then die down.  After another 5-10 seconds the white lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done the first time.  I waited 15-20 seconds then ran into my house to find another witness.  When we returned, we monitored the sky for 10-15 minutes but saw no more lights.  We did, however. see approximately 5-10 airplane lights flying in the area that I had seen the lights.  I did not see these lights during the occurance. I called the Rose Hill police but they said they had no other reports of lights in the sky.  The local nightly news ran a story about strange lights being reported by residents of Winfield Kansas that night, so I called the Winfield police.  They said that there had been numerous reports of lights but that they had no explanation.  There was also a small article about the incident in the Wichita Eagle newspaper the following day.
19980923	19980924	 Bothell (south of), WA	 light	3-5 seconds	Object entered atmosphere from above, traveling east to west.Object entered atmosphere from just east of top dead center, traveling east to west. Object appeared to have a direct trajectory of 20 degrees downward as it traveled.  Initially appeared to be a meteorite, but blossomed into fireball within a half second of being spotted.  Fireball developed, appeared to be white/greenish white.  Looked reminiscent of re-entry of manned space capsules seen in pictures.  Appeared to be eminating from center of object and fanning out to the rear.  Object moved relatively slow compared to the quick meteorites seen in shower months.  Object appeared to burn out, dimming in intensity and just before extinguishment appeared to have several apparent red embers floating behind it. From south of Bothell, elevated at approximately 75 ASL, it appeared as one looks directly south, the bearing was from 160 degrees on the compass going to approximately 250 degrees. There was an aircraft on final for SeaTac who would have had an excellent view of the object, appearing to be about even with the 520 bridge on their approach.  The light as it extinguished appeared to be at an altitude well above the airliner on approach.  No other aircraft were noted to be in the area at the time. The object, for reference, seemed at it&apos;s biggest, to be about 33% the size of a full moon as it is typically seen overhead. The observer is a former military electronics technician, with some aviation experience, and on track to earn his private pilot wings in second quarter &apos;99.  The observer was standing outside with a clear view, on a clear night, with no obstructions impeding the event.
19980525	19980525	 Madison, WI	 cylinder	5 minutes	2 events separated by about 3-5 minutesWhile smoking a cigarette on the porch and watching my girlfriend drive off, what I initially thought to be a shooting star caught my eye. I thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, but realized once I was actually watching it that it wasn&apos;t. The object very faintly glowed a dull brown that would have been hard to see if the motion hadn&apos;t caught my eye. The length of the object was approximately the same as the apparent width of the full moon. It was wider than it was tall: probably a 3 or 4 to 1 ratio. I only caught a second of its east to west motion before my line of sight was blocked by the garage. I hurried down the porch and fell in the process. I was unable to see the object when I stood up -- it was moving pretty quick. I estimate that it covered approximately 20-30 degrees in about 1 second as I watched it. I looked in the direction that it had been traveling for about three or four minutes. A single flashing white light emanated from near Arcturus. It blinked 3 or 4 times, progressively getting brighter with each blink. After the final bright blink, which I estimated to be the same luminosity as a medium-bright Venus, it was no longer visible. There were no clouds in the sky, and I could ses faint stars in the location where it had been blinking. There was only a slight haze and the blinking was much brighter than the dim stars that I could see. Thios event lasted approximately 3-4 seconds. I watched for a few more minutes, but all I saw was a satellite traversing the sky in the east -- quite distant from the location of the other two objects. I have worked at this location for nearly two years and I spend considerable time outside at night smoking cigarettes and watching the skies. I have never seen a bird reflecting the street lamps at night -- that is the only the possible explanation for the first object that I can think of. If it was a bird, I probably would have seen the reflection changing as the bird flapped its wings, but the shape of the object and the glow remained consta! nt. The second object may have been an airplane, although it was quite high for the blinks to have been that bright. Usually when a plane turns you can make out different colored landing lights or something, and they usually don&apos;t just disappear as the second object did. I usually only see airplanes while watching the skies at work, but I have sighted a group of 2 UFOs on another occasion. Other than these two instances, the skies over my work are pretty boring. I am going to contact the Dane County Regional Airport to see if they received other calls or tracked anything unusual last night. Other than that, it&apos;s just another frustrating sighting.
19980215	19980216	 Duluth, MN	 flash	60+ seconds	Various colored lights flashing after power surge &amp; failurePower surge/failure occured at 7:30 pm.  Lights went off but glowed hazy green for several seconds before immense lights began to flash over the foggy sky - central location of flashes from us was WNW.  The first flash was a general bright blue followed by several defined rays that spread out from the circumference of the blue lights this was followed by more flashing - yellow and red lines that horizontally crossed the original set of rays.  The flasing continued a few more seconds, was as bright as lightening: air temp. 39f; pressure 29.90.  We later learned that a powerline had been severed at the junction of Highway 61 and the Ryan Road - 15 miles up the shore of Lake Superior from central downtown Duluth.  It seem to us that a rather large craft may have come a bit too close to ground and that some form of its propellent energy caused the power line to snap.  We walked over to the site of the break later and saw several power company vehicles a couple of squad cars were present but left before we actually reached the scene.
19980607	19980723	 Caracas, D.F. (Venezuela),	 changing	2 min	Observe a unos 3 Kilometros Dos Objetos que se acercaban a velocidad impresionante hasta el vehiculo que yo conduciaEran Ceraca de las cinco de la tarde, cuan a lo lejos rumbo cerca de un tunel observe dos objetos de mucha luz, que se aproximaban a una velocidad desmesurada, ambos objetos, se detuvieron justo frente a mi, y estuvieron cerca de 20 segundos apuntando una fuerte luz que me cegaba, el carro detuvo toda marcha posible, inclusive emisoras de radio, al cabo de los 20 segundos uno de lso objetos apunto hacia el otro una fuerte luz verde, el primer objeto dio varias vueltas al rededor de mi vehiculo, luego el segundo objeto emitio un sonido que imagino que era de muy baja frecuencia, digo esto por que el perro que venia dormido en la parte de atras del vehiculo saltaba mucho de repente y comenzo a ladrar hasta quedar agotado, luego de eso, ambos objetos subieron a tal velocidad que los perdi. Hay algo en particular en esto, cuando uno de los Objetos Acelero, se oy&oacute; un estruendo como un trueno, el carro volvio a encenderse y la radio comenzo a sonar sin ningun problema. No escribi antes esto porque no sabia que existiese una pagina web dedicada a estos temas, y en la policia nadie me crey&oacute;, como es costumbre en este pais.!! Gracias por leer esto..!!

19950704	19980302	 Tacoma (waterfront area), WA	 circle	5 MINUTES	MANY PEOPLE ON DOCK WAITING FOR FIREWORKS DISPLAY SEE A RED CIRCLE HOVERING AND THEN MOVE SLOWLY WEST.ON 04JUL95 I AND MY FAMILY HAD GONE TO THE WATERFRONT AREA OF TACOMA TO WATCH THE ANNUAL FIREWORKS DISPLAY. AT ABOUT 22:00 WE NOTICED (AS DID SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE THERE)  A RED CIRCLE HOVERING JUST IN THE CLOUD LAYER. THERE WERE TWO SEMI-CIRLCE LIGHTS ON THE OBJECT AND THEY FLASHED AT DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES. THE OBJECT HOVERED FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, THEN IT MOVED THROUGH THE CLOUD LAYER TO HOVER CLOSER. AFTER A FEW SECONDS IT BEGAN TO MOVE OFF SLOWLY TO THE WEST. WHILE IT WAS STILL ON THE WESTERN HORIZON (ABOUT 1 MINUTE LATER) TWO FIGHTER TYPE AIRCRAFT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY FROM EAST TO WEST ON APPEARENTLY THE SAME COURSE AS THE CIRCLE OBJECT.
19980108	19980402	 Satellite Point (near, midway between Orlando &amp; Boca), FL	 changing	45 sec.	We were driving S. from Orlando on the toll road towards Boca Raton, FLA. We saw the &apos;moon&apos; glowing a bright orange low in the sky in the east. We realized the moon was high in the sky, and that this was a total anomaly/ufo. It started moving, assuming a cigar shape/outline with a tongue of flame under it and to the the rear. We noticed other cars pulling over to get a better look and as I started to do so I looked up again and saw it disappear, leaving only a glint of light where it had been. Amazing.I am a psychiatric social worker and am perfectly healthy and sane. I am 44yrs. Have a Masters degree. Have always worked. Have never seen a ufo before. I was on holiday with my wife and kid. My wife also saw it, and she has a similar background as myself.
19980429	19980505	 Simpsonville, SC	 light	3 seconds	While driving to work, I noticed a light just below high overcast. The object appeared to be traveling east to west.I was traveling roughly southwest in my car on highway 146 at 45 mph. It first entered my field of view from the left side, or from the east. The object appeared round in shape and was glowing brightly, it was whiteish in color. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to stay just barely below the high overcast until it left my field of view moving westerly. The object never changed direction nor did it change speed. I work in the tire industry as a mechcanical/electrical troubleshooter. I have done this for 12 years. Prior to that I was a machinist for 5 years.
19980309	19980330	 Tucson, AZ	 triangle	10 min	I was traveling east coming home from work and saw three bright, white lights in the SW sky.  They were appeared to be about the size of an eraser.  There were two on top and one on the bottom forming a triangle.  The moon was low in the sky and directly in front of me and the lights were a little lower than the moon.  They did not flicker and they did not move.  I had to turn north to get to my house and I looked over my shoulder as I turned and saw them.  It takes about 30 Sec. to get to my house.  I parked the car and jumped out and looked and they were completely gone.  I ran into the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the whole sky and they were gone and there was no moving lights in the sky.The lights were very bright and pure white.  There were no other colors and they did not flicker.  They were all the same size and appeared about the size of a pencil eraser.  There were two next to each other, horizontally, with a small black space inbetween.  There was one below that was positioned inbetween the top two, forming a triangle.  I was traveling east and watched them for about 20 minutes.  When sitting at a red light, I could determine that the three lights were stationary in the sky.  The moon was very low in the sky that night and directly ahead of me.  The lights were to the right of the moon (southeast) and just a little lower that the moon.  I had to turn north to go to my home and as I turned, I looked over my shoulder and could still see the lights.  I later timed it and it takes 30 seconds after I turn to get to my home.  When I arrived home, I jumped out of my car and looked for the lights and they were gone.  I immediately went into my home and to the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the sky.  The lights were gone and there were no moving lights in the sky, only stars.  I watched for quite a while because I live by Davis Monthan Air Force Base and I wanted to see if they deployed any planes, but they did not.  The base is about 3 miles from where I live. Last fall my daughter and some of her friends saw a UFO over Rincon Mountain and within minutes the air force base was deploying pairs of planes. I have a master&apos;s degree and am a 49 year old female.
19950809	19980131	 I-64 (MM 94, westbound), IN	 triangle	3-5 min.	Summary : It was hovering over the westbound lane at the top othe hill. It was foggy at the bottom of the hill and after starting up I saw it and parked onth e shoulder and stood dirrectly under it. It was triangular in shape. 120-150 &apos; across the back, 100&apos; back to front. It had 4 lights  down its belly. Simsilar to a florrecent light but no defined center. Completely silent I don&apos;t know if hair standing on end from ship or adrenalin. It just floated off into the fog in the valley. Igot back in my truck and hesded on west.I was leaving louisville Ky. on I-64 heading into In.. After climing the fist big hill I started noticing a lot activity in the clear sky. It was about 01:45 I noticed what seemed to be landing lights but a very stange shade of white. It&apos;s movement seemed odd also because it did not seem to be getting closer fast enough for it&apos;s size. It finally turned to the noth and after awhile I for got about it. 20-25 miles latter I caught ashight of the odd lights agiain still dirrectly in front of me. On this part 64 the road is hilly and curvey and I lost sight of it each time I went in the valleys. I came around a left hand curve and started up the hill and when I came out of the fog it was hovering over my lane at the top of the hill. I was almost at the top when I pulled onto the shoulder and jumped out of my semi and stood in the middle of the highway in my socks looking up at a triangular 100&apos; from front to back and 120-150&apos; across the back. It had 4 lights across its belly from front to back like aflorresent bulb but you could not see the center of the light. It seemed to be constant with no breaks on either end or down each side of its slot in the bottom of this ship. The air was completely still with not a sound comming from this craft.I grew up on Air Force base&apos;s  and have seen and heard just about every thing flowen in our inventory of air craft. I stood ther for 3-5 min. before it just floated off into the valley into the fog. the back of the craft was also triangular in shape. From  top to bottom 30&apos;. With twp small lights one on each side like tail lights. No sooner had it dissapeared then two trucks came around the curve and up the hill. Of course after it had left. I got back in my truck and one of them asked me if I needed any help. I can only say they did not see it. On the other side of the hill is tree small truckstops. I did not hear anyone talking on the radio about it so I guess no one ther saw any thing either.
0000	19980925	 San Gabriel, CA	 cigar	hour or so	Cigar or oblong shaped object, just sat there in orange and reddish brown clouds.  Never did anything and we went to bed.I was  curious about some of the 1970&apos;s sightings.  I was party to one of them but for whatever reason our family of five (all witness) never reported or talked about it until recently when more people and shows began investigating some of the strange phenomena.  I was a cigar like shape surrounded by orange, brown and reddish clouds or &quot;smoke&quot;.  It was large and long and just sat there doing absolutely nothing.  In fact after a few snapshots (which did not develop, we had a regular fast shutter speed camera),  we got a bit bored and went inside I believe.  It went away and we never saw it again.  It was in San Gabriel, California and seemed so close we could touch it if we had climbed a large tree.  This is the only way I could describe it from a child&apos;s memory, but I still remember it clearly, but not exactly afterwards.  We headed for bed after waiting for a long time for it to do something. I am very curious to know if anyone has ever seen this type of UFO in the past or recently.
19980313	19980313	 Tulsa, OK	 light	20 seconds	One small light overhead.  no flashing lights.constant color.  apparantly no wings.  low altitude(under low cloud ceiling). fast moving to east northeast.  dissappeared spontaneously at 15 degree pitch above horizon.one object witnessed by two adults, ages 25, 22.  Object was seen directly overhead and moving at a constant fast speed.  Object had a amber glow and did not change colors or shape. object was a round light.  Witnesses followed light for about two blocks but Object was moving too fast to catch.  Object was low enough to fly under low cloud cover but light was too small to be a conventional aircraft.  Object had no wings and no flashing lights associated with conventional aircraft(such as on wings or atop).  Object was out of witnesses sight for 2 seconds and then was not seen again.  Last seen by witnesses at 15 degree pitch above horizon.
19980316	19980316	 Lunenburg, MA	 light	3 seconds	Bright green light moved quickly overhead from WSW to ENE, transversing 30 degrees of sky in less than three seconds.Bright green spere of light, about 3 times the visual size of Venus, tranversed the sky, directly over my location, from WSW to ENE. Object was spotted out sliding glass doors. I calculate my field of view to be about 30 degrees of sky from top to horizon. The object transveresed this arc in 1 1/2 to 3 seconds in a straight line. There are pine trees about 50 yrds from my location, and as the object disappeared into that ridge line, it was not low enough to light the trees or ground, inspite of being very bright. It was about 3 to 4 times the brightness of Venus at it&apos;s brightest. Did not appear to be a flare, or meteor, although the speed seemed slower than meteors I have witnessed. I also witnessed an unreported white fireball, at least half the diameter of the full moon, from the same vantage point, EXACT same tragectory, in August 1997. Flight characteristics were similar. Although I found the first sighting very odd, I dismissed it as either a meteor, or some incindiary, because the first, August 97 gave off &quot;sparks&quot; as it flew. If it was a meteor in August, it seemed to large to have entered the atmosphere unreported.
19980101	19980101	 Pittsburgh, PA	 formation	20 minutes	Summary : 28-30 Lighted objects coming up over the city hovering and almost coliding with one another. Red lights escorting them. Vanished.7:30 pm witnessed over 25 hovering, soundless crafts. Bright glassey lights where coming from the objects. Low to the ground, spining, slow moving. Red lights were escorting crafts. Traveling in straight lines over the city, then dispersing on there own. A fighter plane flew overhead, and they all disappeared. 3 witnesses, sober, stable women. I am 37, and not crazey. All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. Reported to the airport. They saw nothing. Found that hard to believe, because they were coming one after the others in regular sequences. I do not believe in UFO&apos;s, so I am looking for a solution to what we saw. Called the radio stations, no sky shows that night.
19980520	19980525	 Burlington, VT	 light	20 seconds	On May 20, 1998, at 22:40, I was drawn to my 3rd floor studio apartment window (western side of building) by some noise on the street below. After I located the origin of the noise below my open window, I raised my eyes to look west, out over Lake Champlain which lies between New York state and Vermont. I saw what appeared to be 2 wingtip landing lights from a heavy jet aircraft, such as a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, yet steady and no noise was heard. I quickly ascertained that the lights were far too spread apart and far too bright to be aircraft lights. After approx. 10 seconds from initial sighting, the 2 lights began to converge, left light moving toward the right light. At 15 seconds the 2 were very close together and began to head in a northerly direction, left to right from my westward looking viewpoint. However, during the last 5 seconds (approx.), the lights became smaller and smaller, then completely vanished at approx. 20 seconds from initial sighting, both still moving left to right.Detailed Report--This sighting occurred while in my 3rd floor studio apartment in my city of residence, Burlington, VT, on or about May 20, 1998, at 22:40.  I was drawn to my window (western side of building) by some noise on the street below.  About 15 teenagers, were skateboarding southbound on the street I live on, producing a low pitch roaring sound on the pavement below.  After watching them for a couple of minutes, they were nearly out of sight.  I raised my eyes toward the western horizon, looking out over Lake Champlain which lies between New York state and Vermont, I saw 2 steady white lights at an elevation of 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon, and 5 times the brightness of the star Sirius, at approx

19980421	19980427	 Broomfield, CO	 teardrop	2 minutes	We were driving home from a coffee shop in Broomfield and we thought we heard a police siren so we pulled over but we didn&apos;t see any emergency vehicles.  My friend was in the back seat looking out the back window and she shouted to us to look.  There were 3 tear dropped shaped objects in a triangle formation, the radio station went out and we just heard static for 2 minutes.  Then the objects just dissapeared. The radio came back on.there were 3 tear dropped shaped objects, they were silver but not glowing, they were metallic and shinning.  Hoovered and then dissappeared after a few minutes.
19620101	19980118	 Key West, FL	 sphere	3 to 5 minutes	Summary : in the very early morning hours of 1962, I don&apos;t recall the date or month, at the time I was only 10 years of age, a very loud whistleing sound woke me, as I woke up I noticed a bright light coming in my bedroom window, when I pulled back the curtain I saw a very very large glowing ball coming slowly over the top of my house, it was flying very low but the only sound I heard was the whistleing sound I told you about earlier, I was very scared and covered my head with the covers until it was gone, I am not saying this was a UFO I am only saying that it was something very unexplainable and it has stayed with me all these years, since Key West has a military base I often wondered if maybe it wasn&apos;t something the military was testing, but if so I never saw anything like it again, if it had not been for the whistleing noise I may have even thought it was ball lightning or something like that but the erie sound makes me wonder.The shape was completley round, very very large , slow moving and, and had a constant whistle. There was only one object. Color was a very bight yellow-orange not unlike the sun.I myself was only ten at the time now I am a housewife in SC.
19980923	19980923	 Plymouth, WI	 circle	4 or 5 seconds	Bluish-green ball of light, moving from the east to the west.  Object had a tail.While driving home from work on HWY 23 between Fond du Lac, WI and Plymouth, WI I saw through the driver side window a bluish green ball of light with a tail on it.  The light lasted for approx 4 to 5 seconds and just disapeared.  I was traveling in a Westernly direction and the object was moving in the same direction.  The object was about 1/4 the size of the full moon roughly.
19980423	19980423	 Oneonta, NY	 light	4 Min	2 Unidentified Objects seen over MountainI am a patrol Officer for the Oneonta and Milford NY area at Approx. 0401 While checking a clients property (Fox Care Center) I observed 2 Objects above the mountain across the Highway from me for a better prospective looking from the rear of the property which is located on a mountain you would be looking across to the other mountain on top of this other mountain near the location of the objects is a Radio tower the objects appeared to be about 100 to 200 feet above this tower to the west both appeared as very bright White lights steady no flashing and no colored lights I observed 1 travel to the east and 1 to the west the 1 traveling to the west then stopped for about 3 secs and then flew back to the other object until it was directly over the other object and they disappeared During this Time I could hear no sounds other than vehicles on the highway most of the time during the sighting it was dead silent, I contacted my dispatch and asks if any Helicopters are in the area, He advised no Helicopters are up when I went off duty at 0500 my dispatcher advised about a month ago while working dispatch at the Sheriffs Office he received a call from a farmer that lives in the exact area and the farmer complained about helicopters flying low over his fields disturbing his cows. No helicopters were in the area at that time I have 8 years prior Military and can say they did not act like anything I have ever seen I would be happy to draw a diagram of the sighting and I will check into it in more detail

19980129	19980129	 Swadlincote Nr Burton upon Trent (UK/England),	 triangle	00:10:00	Summary : A Triangular object with lights in each corner and a central light was seen. It circled slowly at low altitude (500 ft) below cloud cover. At one point it stopped and hovered for a minute.As the object banked away from us we could see the triangle shape in pale white lines liojing the corner lights. Seen by myself and my son from our car. Observers were college manager and a school boy.
19750801	19980315	 Ravenna (near  West Branch State Park), OH	 cylinder	20 min	5 of us were standing outside talking, I felt as though someone was looking at me, I turned around and saw it it was&apos;nt moving, then stated towards us, we ran away from it,i went over water&amp;trees, was gone.When we saw it, it was just hanging over the water,making no noise at all. it was a vey shiny metalic cylinder shape. We wacthed fo awhile as it started moving towards us.All of us ran to the garage.it went over the treetops at a fairly slow rate of speed. Next thing I knew 2hrs had passed...I was sitting in the garage by myself. there was a terrible thunderstorm. my boyfriend was yelling for me,I went to him....He asked me where I had been, I told him as far as I know I was in the garage....He sad he had looked for me there already. We never talked about it again
19980924	19980924	 Bowling Green, OH	 flash	5 seconds	We saw a bright oval shaped flash of white light that traveled across the sky near the horizon.My friend and I are both students at Bowling Green State University.  Last night at about 1:30 am, we decided to take a study break and walk around outside.  After about 1 minute, we saw an object near the horizon.  It was a small circular white light that was traveling at a slow speed.  Since there is an airport nearby, we thought we were seeing the landing lights of an airplane.  However, the object slowed to a stop and then emitted a white flash and disappeared.  The flash was not very bright, but yet it seemed to cover the entire sky.  We estimated the object&apos;s distance to be about 2 or 3 miles.  We heard no sound.
19961001	19980430	 West Houston (Greenridge @ Westiemer Rd.; near Galleria), TX	 formation	30 SECONDS	Three bright orange-white lights moving in a V formation from northeast to Southwest The center light would change position front to rear and then merge with the other lights. The light on the left of the formation began to move eratically and then moved off in 90 degree turn from the others. The lights made no sound and moved faster than airplane but slower then a shooting star.Three bright orange-white lights moving in a V formation from northeast to Southwest The center light would change position front to rear and then merge with the other lights. The light on the left of the formation began to move eratically and then moved off in 90 degree turn from the others. The lights made no sound and moved faster than airplane but slower then a shooting star. It appeared the objects were pretty high in the sky , perhaps about 5,000 ft.
19970310	19980310	 New York City, NY	 light	15 minutes	Strange lights above New York CityI was waiting for a taxi on Park Ave. It was a very cold and fiercly windy night. I looked up at the full moon behind the thickening layer of clouds. It glowed beatifully in a halo of mist. As I was admiring the view I suddenly noticed a strange point of light &quot;wandering&quot; around the sky at extremely high speed. It crossed my field of view in under 2 seconds. Because I could see a slight halo effect around the light I decided that it must be either inside or above the cloud layer. This would mean that its altitude was above 20,000 feet. The light was extremely small yet intensely bright. It was yellow or gold in color. The point had some dimensionality---it appeared to be a tiny sphere or oval---it definitely had some ball-like shape to it. After zig-zaging around the sky, making sudden turns and traveling in wild arcs, it vanished. The whole process took only about 2 seconds. I watched the sky for about 10 more minutes. During that time I witnessed 4 more lights appear, zig-zag at extremely high speed, and then dissappear. I could hardly believe my eyes. I was so entranced, I didn&apos;t think to ask any passers by to look at it and confirm what I was seeing. At one point two of the lights were in the sky at the same time, flying in very different erratic paths, almost as if they were dogfighting. All the other lights appeared in sequence, only 1 at a time. In each case, they seemed to appear from about the same point in the sky and then follow roughly the same erratic flight path and then vanish at approximately the same area in the sky. I could not tell if they were simply turning off or going behind thick clouds. After about 10 minutes the activity stopped. These lights were so small and fast that they were hard to catch even if one was looking up, so I wonder if anyone else saw them. A number of commercial jets were coming in or taking off from area runways during this event and they were quite clearly different in both appearance, sound, and behavior from the lights I witnessed. For one thing, the lights were single points of light and seemed to be far above the clouds, and moved much much faster than any of the jets (or any jet I&apos;ve ever seen for that matter). The lights did not flash or change color, although there was a slight flicker to them as they moved. It almost appeared as if something was literally skipping along the upper atmosphere. I considered the possibility that it might be some sort of debris burning up, but no debris can change direction or travel in series of loops, arcs and sudden right-angle turns, as these lights did.
19980923	19980924	 Bayview, WA	 fireball	4-5 sec	movement from east to west, travelling appx. 45 degree angle towards the groundI thought it was  fireworks at first, then considered ita meteor because it flared out.  Object had a tail, was greenish in the center w/bluish around the green, and white around the outside.  I was on I-5 heading south...on the south side of the hills that separate Bellingham from the Skagit Valley.  I was going down hill.  At first thought it was fireworks because it was close...then it disappeared.  Observed against the night sky. It was moving fast.  My cell phone was plugged into car cigarette lighter. I had tried to use my cell earlier and it kept shorting out.  The cell phone plug light kept switching from red to green.  I had tried to make a call and my cell phone would not place the call.  I received a message &quot;you have 1 voice mail&quot; when I dialed the number and pressed the send button.  I gave up...then I saw this object appx. 30-45 minutes later.  I had another person in the car but she did not see the object.  She said &quot;I wonder if it was a UFO.&quot; At 10:15PM I was listening to Art Bell and realized I was not the only person who saw an object in the night sky. I then decided to report this event.
19900505	19980329	 Arlington, VA	 chevron	2.5	Object sighted in bi-noc while stargazing.  Object in sight for approx 2.5 3.0 sec due to other object in sight (tree)  object moved faster then any other object veiwed in this area due to sky/stargazing.  Am familar with both civilan and military aircraft both older and current.The object was first sighted while stargazing with bi-noc&apos;s.  Object was in focus, but slightly distorred due to speed of traval across veiwing area.  Attepmts to re-aquire object after passing by trees unsuccessful.  object was chevron shaped with 6 circles inside the chevron. (each circle was seperate from the others by approx .05&quot; in the bi-noc&apos;s)  Object was moving at extremely high speed and was viewed for 2.5 - 3.0 seconds prior to loss of sight due to tree in vision.  The chevron was very visable around the circles and appeared almost to be a &quot;B-2&quot; shape with no idendifiable markings or identifiable as a B-2 due to the lack of the &quot;tail&quot; section.  This was NOT, repaet NOT a overfly of the B-2 or any other USAF, US Army, US Navy or civilian Aircraft that I have veiwed in the last 10 years or prior to that. You may contact me via e-mail or snail-mail for more information if you require it.
19970526	19980526	 Pompton Lakes, NJ	 disk	00:15	I was driving in a car. I saw a saucer metal shaped object, a metal I&apos;ve never seen before, hovering in the sky, above the falls. It seemed to stand still, but shined bright from the reflection of the sun. As a group of trees hid the object for two seconds, I came back into a clearing and it had vanished. The object was brillant. It was in two sections. The shape was of a saucer. It was big. I never saw such a sight in my life. I new it was not of this world.
19980203	19980203	 Portage, MI	 sphere	1min.30sec	Two white balls of light about 30sec apart going ENE Very bright traveling in the same pathSun just set could see a number of stars,no clouds for once.straight up when first observed. bright ball of light going east and a little north.Was allmost out of sight when another one just like the other one following the same path.About a -2 on star brightness scale.I am an amateur astronomer and know the sky fairly well.I thought they were satillights maybe but in the same path?
19980924	19980925	 North Pole, AK	 sphere	10 minutes	Two Orange sphere appeared low on horizon just to left of North Star.  One was hidden during filming I believe by trees.  They hovered, not coming closer nor farther.  Seemed to be fiery and rotating I belive counetr clockwise.  I have video of whole event.  They disappeared as fast as they appeared.I don&apos;t even believe in UFO&apos;s or even the phenomenon that I witnessed last night, but replaying the video has prompted me to tell someone. September 24, 1998 North Pole Alaska approx 2235 AKDT until 2243 AKDT Northern sky low just west of the North Star. I had been outside filming the Northern Lights which were spectacular last night.  I happened to look out kitchen window and saw two orange fiery balls hovering just above the horizon.  I grabbed by video camera and filmed them.  Only a short time did both appear together as the one on left was lower and believe the tree line blocked clear view.  They did not move forward or back or up or down only when they finally disappeared as they seemed to slowly lower and sink into the horizon. The object can be seen clearly and rotating, I think counter clockwise. You can clearly see gases or image like fire encircling the objects. They appear like giant asteroids but how could they appear so close and yet not enter the atmosphere.  I have NEVER seen nor witnessed anything like it.  You can hear the dogs howl and whine in fear of whatever it was.  I tried to call local news etc., but guess they think I&apos;m nuts.  I called the Air Force Security at Eilison AFB nearby and they put me on hold and simply said.  &quot;Contact public affairs in the morning and they will come and pick up the video.&quot; Dave Myers System Programmer University of Alaska 907-474-6266Witness was interviewed on Art Bell 9/25
19980329	19980329	 Lunenburg, MA	 fireball	2 sec.	Green fireball seen falling quicly from South to North, looked almost as big as moon, followed by two smaller pieces/ debris.At 8:18pm EST, in lunenburg MA, a green fireball, the appearant size almost of the moon, was seen falling rapidly from zenith to horizon in a South to North direction. It was the color of a green glow stick, seemed to have a slight trail, and was followed by two flanking objects, same color, but much smaller, which traveled at the same speed. The trailing objects were about a thumb at arms length back from the main object, with the appearant size each of the planet Venus. They gave the impression of being debris from the main object. They trasversed about 40 degrees of sky, as visible through a large sky light, in less than two seconds. The impression was of a rapidly falling object. The fire ball itself seemed fairly solid, only green flame like fuzziness at the very edges of the object made fireball the best description. There was the slight trail, very small, but no pronounced smoke trail that would be expected from a meteor. Except for the size and lack of smoke, seemed possible it was a meteor. No change of direction was seen during the time of observation. Lost sight of the object as it disapeared from field of view, about 15% above the horizon...
19980329	19980402	 Yakima, WA	 changing	10 Min	The object changed color and shape. It kept the same course and speed flying into the wind.When we first saw the object it was to our West and was bright orange. It was in front of a cloud and was easly pointed out. The object was always moving directly east. It changed color from orange to white and flew directly over our heads. It was about 1000 feet high. It was changing shapes. There was no noise. We have a clear video of this object.
19980618	19980320	 Narcoossee, FL	 light		Heard on the local news a report regarding a possible UFO witnessed  3/17/98  in a small community S.E. of Orlando FL, called &quot;Narcoossee&quot;. Witnesses reported a &quot;bright light&quot; that lit up the sky &amp; one resident/witness related that the event actually &quot;scared&quot; 11 chickens to DEATH! NOTE FOR INVESTIGATORS:  Local Orlando TV, CH.9, an ABC affiliate, has a copy of the 911 call concerning this event, it was aired on the 11pm news broadcast, 3/18/98. Authorities assume &quot;someone was possibly shooting flares...&quot;, according to the news report...... ***************************************************************** UPDATE: Narcoossee, FL event of 3/17/98 According to ABC News affiliate, Channel 9 TV, Orlando FL, the &quot;Bright Light(s)&quot; experienced by numerous witnesses on the evening of 3/17/98, was due to &quot;Test Flares&quot; launched at the Avon Park Bombing Range. HOWEVER.....if one looks at a map, one can easily see that the distance from the Northern edge of the Avon Park Range to the town of Narcoossee is in EXCESS of 50 miles! HOW are they (whomever THAT may be!) &quot;testing&quot; flare-launches from Avon Park with the flares dropping over 50 miles away to the North?! ****************************************************************** ADDED NOTE: According to Ch 9 sources, the &quot;testing&quot; would continue for &quot;the next several nights&quot;. (Additionally, I Emailed the TV Stations Programming Director &amp; asked them to explain why flares launched from Avon Park Boming Range would be landing in Narcoossee, 50 + miles to the north! Also, one would assume that in &quot;testing&quot; said flares, PART of the test would be to view the flares lighting &quot;effectiveness&quot;......therefore I asked CH 9 TV to send a Film Crew to observe &amp; report how/why the tests were going by observing govermental workers that by all rights SHOULD be in the vicinity of Narcoossee, or any potential landing area to document the results of any &quot;test launch&quot;. I ALSO asked the TV station in my Email if having HOT Flares, buring brightly enough to have one resident blame them for the deaths of 11 chickens, drop on unsuspecting, populated areas such as Narcoossee, did not constitute a risk (duly warranted?) of fire/damage/injury/death from fires that WOULD occur if said flare(s) were to easily land on a residential/commercial/occupied structure.......I have not had a reply to that as yet.
19970815	19980408	 Parkersburg (10 miles south of Ohio/W.Virginia Border near), WV	 triangle	ten minutes	Observed silent, slow moving craft moving in Northeasterly direction. Lost sight as it moved over hills.I was training a new driver for my truck route. After we had passed the Ohio/Virginia border, he yelled,&quot;Look at that&quot;.  So, I pulled the truck over and we both got out.  Just to our left, and bigger than my hand as I stretched out my arm, was a black triangular craft with a dim, white, light on each corner and a dim red/orange light in the middle.  It seemed to be so close, you could throw a rock up and hit it.  However, it did not even make the slightest noise.  We observed it for at least ten minutes, as it glided toward the large hills that dominate the area on Interstate 77.  It should be noted that Wright Patterson AFB. is only a couple hundred miles to the west of this sighting. Personally, I do not believe that this craft was manufactured anywhere on earth. It did not have the look of any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen before or since. Also,  maybe you remember the story of Indrid Cold, this was the name of the alien who kidnapped a man from Mineral Wells, W.Virginia.  Mineral Wells, was only six miles more south from this sighting.  After much reading, I find there is supposed to be a vortex of sorts in this general vacinity.  Well, that&apos;s about the extent of what I have to say about this particular incident.  Thanks for listening. I appreciate it. ((Name and address deleted))
19980101	19971231	 Allentown, PA	 light	30 minutes +	Summary : One object, too far to see size and shape, one blinking light  red/green/white.  Stayed in oproximately same spot for about 30 minutes +.  Seems to be hovering pretty high off the ground, but too low for a star.We viewed this object with a 10/50 binoculars.  We can only see that it is a fast blinking light, it was too far to see, about 20 miles away.  It blinked rapidly red, green and white.  It didnt move much, just seemed to hover pretty high off the ground, not moving fast at all. But a couple 1000 feet high off the ground, deffinitely not a star.  We called the airport and they showed nothing on radar, which was a 40 mile distance, and it was with in that proximity.  There were 4 of us that observed the UFO.  First was Carl, 45, no prior arrests, and didnt drink anything all night.  Second was Phil, 15, no drinks and no arrests.  Third was Pat, a little alchohol, and no prior charges.  Fourth was Rick, 26, no prior arrests, very little to drink.
19960614	19980310	 inflight/from  Air France jet, MD	 disk	5 to 10 sec	White disk flew underneath jetliner as we were descending towards Dulles Intl. We were at about 10-12,000 feet according to cabin monitors. The object moved rapidly towards N/NW. No wings, tail, engines or markings other than two black lines extending towrds center from outer rim. It was between jetliner and patchy clouds below. Maybe less than 500 feet below. Very clear view from rear window seat.
19980924	19980924	 Vancouver (Canada), BC	 circle	5 seconds	Ball of light low in sky descending slowly at steep angle from East to WestAt approximately 9:00-9:30 pm, i was looking out a south facing window and witnessed a ball of light descending across my field of view from East to West.  The light appeared too large, moved at a rate to quickly, and angle to steep for it to be an airplane.  It also moved to slowly for it to seem like a shooting star.  It did not leave a trail. The path of the object was linear and did not vary, and descended from east to west at an angle of approx. 30 degrees. The light from the object seemed very white. I only witnessed it for a period of less than 5 seconds before my view was obstructed.
19971025	19980201	 St. Thomas, (U. S. Virgin Islands), VI	 light	5-8 SECDS	Summary : Was staring at a very clear night sky over the Caribbean when overhead I saw what appeared to be a satellite (I see them very often).  This object started moving in a straight path overhead, but then made three radical changes in a north-northwest direction while moving at the same incredible speed.  To my knowledge, no jet can make those manuevers and satellites must travel a fixed path in orbit.  The entire event lasted around 5 seconds.  No weird lights, just what looked like a brighter (larger?) than normal satellite making a crazy pattern in the sky unlike anything should be able to do physically.I am a fund-raising consultant who works to help non-profits and churchs raise money for capital campaigns.  I was working for a church in Charlotte Amalie when this event occurred.
19961120	19980312	 Surfside (on the beach), TX	 diamond	seemedlike 3hours	It appeared above me app. 200 ft. with 3 lights; {leftlight, red} {right light,green} {middle light, bright white.} The middle light blinded me so bad I couldn&apos;t see anything else, Itried to move and found all I could move was my eyes from one side to the other. It then moved just to the right of me and then back to the left .I seemed to be in an upside downicecream shaped cone of brilliant white light the whole time. Then after what seemed to be 3 hours later, it just vanished out  of sight. I nevered reported it because I was scared to death!

19980923	19980925	 Mukilteo, WA	 light	2 sec	Additional sighting of &quot;Greenish&quot; ball of light.While listening to the Art Bell radio show and hearing about the sightings, I walked outside of the building where I work and started looking around.  I was facing at 310 degrees (compass heading) and looking up at what I think was the Big Dipper.  To the left of the &quot;handle&quot; of the Big Dipper, at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon, a ball of white light with a greenish glow arround the circumfrence;  looked as if it dropped straight down.  The light  lasted about 2 full seconds.  I&apos;m not sure if there was a &quot;tail&quot; or just the image of the bright light on my  retina.  I would approximate the size of the ball of light as about 5 to 10  times the size of the dot of light of Jupiter which was in the sky behind me.
19980410	19980411	 El Cajon, CA	 cigar	10 minutes	Observed object, nothing around it.  Pulsing red light, bright-dim-bright-dim. Moved slowly toward us.  Through binoculars, could see marquise-shaped lights, largest in center, and tapering to smaller in size towards edges. As approached, went up in altitude.  Directly overhead, shot up quickly to a pin-prick size, then disappeared completely.At 5:45 A.M. Pacific time, I looked out my kitchen window and saw a bright, intensely red light. The sky was clear, no clouds. We had just switched to Daylight Savings Time last Saturday.  The red light pulsed bright-dim approximately every second.  I looked at it for approximately thirty seconds, noting that it was not moving.  I went upstairs to get our binoculars.  I raised the blinds in the bedroom, waking up my wife.  I told her, &quot;Come here, there&apos;s something in the sky.&quot;  She observed the same red light.  We both determined it was not an airplane.  In fact, we are near the approach flight path for Lindbergh Field in San Diego, and during the event, we saw the lights of a jet on final approcah, and the plane&apos;s lights were below the height of the red object.  We also determined it could not be a helicopter.  I would also like to note that it was extremely early in the morning and there was no traffic noise, and we heard absolutely nothing from this object.  If it had been a helicopter, we would have heard the blades. My wife went downstairs to get our 35 millimeter camera (autofocus-type) to take a picture of the object.  I retreived the binoculars and went downstairs also.  My wife took two pictures of the object, hopefully one at its bright pulse and one at its dim pulse. To my observation, it moved slowly from the southwest toward the northeast, but not in a straight line.  It moved in what I would call a Lazy S configuration.  During all of this time, the pulsing of the lights did not change.  When it got directly over my head, it stopped and it seemed like it disappeared.  I looked for it through the binoculars again, and I found it, but it seemed much smaller and dimmer than when we first observed it, and then it completely disappeared.  It seemed to me as if it went straight up very quickly.  My wife did not see this movement because she had gone inside to try and find someone to call. My wife observed the object through the binoculars, and she reported that it appeared to her that the object had seven marquise-shaped lights that were glowing brighter than the surrounding part of the &quot;structure&quot;.  The largest one in the middle seemed to her to be the one that was pulsing.  Each of the marquise-shaped sections were yellowish at the centers, graduating out to orange, and then red, with the spaces in between red also. I am 44 years old, retired USN Chief.  I work as a Draftsman/Design Engineer for a metals manufacturer.  I have never seen an object like this before. My wife is 43 years old, works as a freelance court reporter.  She&apos;s never seen anything like this before.  We have been married ten years this September and have two cats.  I have three children from a previous marriage and two grandchildren.  We&apos;ve lived in this home since 1989. One other thing we would like to report is that we are close to a mountain in Spring Valley, CA called San Miguel.  Atop this mountain are a multitude of communications installations for probably every radio and TV station in our county, as well as Tijuana, Mexico.  We don&apos;t know if that has any bearing, but we did want to mention this. When we get the film developed, we will send the two pictures via regular mail.
19971208	19980401	 E. Wenatchee, WA	 light	3-5 minutes	It was a ball of light that was orange in the center with a red haze around it. When it passed overhead it broke in two and continued on, and broke into other pieces.The object which was a ball of light that had an orange center and a red haze around it, was approx. 4,000 ft. up because it just barely cleared the mountains (Cascades? Leavenworth area), as it was traveling from west to east, at a constant speed, little faster than a cessna.  As the object was overhead, it broke into 2 pieces.  The second piece broke away at a 90 degree angle and remained at a distance approx. 500 ft. from the first object and continued parallel through the sky.  Both objects sent smaller objects toward one another and continued east when we lost the object over badger mountain. The sky was clear, no clouds, it was night.  There was another aircraft in the vicinity but it was not chasing the object.  The object produced no noise, no tail and no sparks. The other witness, contacted the local airport and was informed that nothing was seen. I contacted McChord Airforce base in Tacoma, WA and was told to contact the local police.  I have also contacted MUFON and no answer has ever been given.  I can tell the difference between an object re-entering the earth, like a rocket or falling satelite, this object maintained this altitude, and there was no tail at all. I have an AAS degree, with a major in engineering and computer science. I would like an explanation of what we saw.
19971230	19980202	 Milton (north of), FL	 triangle	one min	Summary : Saw triangle craft with 5 white lights on front and 1 red light on bottom. elev approx 500-1000 ft, moving approx 50 mph in a SW direction. Made only a low humming noise.coming home from ball practice, my daughter and myself saw this black triangular craft.  We stopped the car at the end of the drive way and turned engine off to listen. Heard low humming noise, Craft appeared to be on flight coming from the direction of Eglin AFB headed toward Pensacola NAS.  Moon was small sliver no clouds seen. the lights were: one on the front tip, one in the middle of each side and oone on each wing tip or the points of the triangle on the sides, the back was straight across without lights, one red flashing light in the middle of the underneath side.
19671110	19980129	 Highway 71 between Clearmont, Missouri and Maryville, Missou, MO	 unknown	2-3 minutes	Summary : Noticed a semi-circular array of white lights with a pulsing middle light.  Observed object in southern sky.  Actually heard propulsion system activate before ship moved at a terrific speed to the north and west of sighting position.  Too dark and no moonlight to visualize true shape of craft.  The night was very clear and cold. On way to county seat viewed an array of white lights in southern sky.Traveling south on Highway 71 toward county seat, Maryville.  I was 19 at the time.  The other two individuals, men, were slightly older.  We noted a group of lights, in the sky to our right, paralleling our movement to the south and east on the highway.  The driver of the car pulled off onto a side road and the three of us stood outside of the car and observed the lights.  Upon first viewing the object it appeared to have 4-5 white lights on the bottom side it.  In the middle of this array was a pulsating light that would gradually change colors from red to orange to yellow to a bluish cast never actually going completely out.  The object was approximately 1/2 mile to our right and was moving to the east slowly.  Elevation was approximately 1/4 mile.  The object kept moving closer, in the air, and then came to a complete stop.  After stopping, in the sky, there was still no sound.  There were no other competing lights or phenomena so there was no distraction.  The highway was exceptionally quiet, no traffic.  As I gazed at the object and was observing the pulsating of the central light I heard an almost imperceptible sound.  Rather like a low pitched moan which seemed to be emitted from the object in the sky.  The object then moved from the point just to the east of us at a terrific speed and was out of sight in a matter of 2-3 seconds.  There was the almost inaudible hum and then the thing moved from a dead stop to the north and west and was gone.  I went into the Air Force the next year and served a year and one day in Vietnam, 70-71.  I have seen many types of jet aircraft and observed them in flight and have never seen such an array of lights, so closely together and the pulsating ability of the one cente one.  I have a college degree in business/technology and a separate technical school degree in electronics and am well read.  I have never anyone else who has seen or observed anything similar to this craft.  There was no sonic boom, when it took off or anything.  I did have corroborating discussio! ns from two other college aged people from two different places that night, though.  One to the south and east noted the same actual light array but, from a farther distance.  The other was from the north and west and noted a similar object hovering in a pasture area near the town of Elmo.  This event has haunted me since.  No one believes me, trully but, I know what I saw.  One of the two other men is now dead.  He drowned and the other guy still lives in the area but, I never see him.  I work for the State of Missouri and have a job of importance and responsibility.  I just thought that I would pass on my story.  I hope that this may dovetail with some other accounts.  Thank you.
19940520	19980301	 Liberal, KS	 sphere	15-20 min	2 matalic spears connected to each other hovered in the southern sky for about 15-20 min.2 matalic sphears that were connected to eachother, hovered in one spot for 15-20 min.  they were spherical but were bade up of alot of flat sides.  I went in to get something to get a better look at it and when I came back it was gone.
19980422	19980508	 Shelton, WA	 circle	3 seconds	I was Parked at a stoplight, a light just above the horizon caught my eye.  A large, round, glowing object passed directly in front of me.As I was parked at a stoplight, waiting for the light to turn green, a glowing ball of light caught my attention.  I looked up in time to see the object moving north to south across my veiw out my front window.  The object was just above the horizon, and appeared to be traveling at a slight angle towards the ground and seemed to be only a couple hundred feet above the earth. The sighting lasted approximately 2-3 seconds.  The size of the object was not quite as large as a full moon.  The shape was essentially round and appeared to be moving through a either low clouds or a haze.  The object glowed much like a street light illuminating the fog near it on a foggy night.  The color seemed to be a pale orange.  I was in my car with the engine running, but could not hear any sound associated with the event(My first inclination was that it was an aircraft going down; the sighting occured very close to Sanders Field, but the object was much too large).  I am a 33 year-old male,married, with two young children.  I was most recently employed as a credit analyst for a national credit bank, but now am a full-time student.  I have never seen anything like this.
19960501	19980403	 Rochester, NY	 triangle	10 mins	I saw three triangle shaped craft fly over my neighborhood.It was early in the morning (appx 1:00 am) and I was in my room (second floor) when I looked out the window and noticed bright lights. It appeared to be a low flying airplane and I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later I noticed the same thing and I went outside to my backyard.  A large, slow moving, black, triangular craft with lights was moving across the sky.  Ahead of it, was the object I had previously seen that I thought was a plane, it was the same triangle craft.  There was also a third triangle craft.  They were moving in single file from east to west.  I stood beneath them as they passed and I could hear a very faint hum, it was barely audible.  Other than that, they were silent.  I would estimate that they were 100-300 yards in width. This happened a couple of years ago, so I apoligize for the lack of description.  I submitted this because I saw a report on this website (NTL UFO Reporting Center) from Rochester that also dealt with triangular craft.
19980611	19980611	 Kansas City, MO	 light	5 minutes	Single white light, no flashing green, red or white light.  Traveling from WNW to ESE.  Followed about two minutes later by similar light, traveling in same direction.At approximately 9:58 pm I went outside to investigate what at first sounded like thunder. There were approximately four loud booms.  I looked up to see that the sky was cloudless.  I told my roommate &quot;thunder doesn&apos;t go boom, boom.&quot; While looking up I saw the first light, about the brightness of Venus, traveling from WNW to ESE.  I thought it strange that there appeared to be only one light and no other blinking lights.  There was no sound of a jet either. I ran in to get my binoculars but could only make out a vague, black silhouette whose shape was not readily apparent.  I told my friend to come outside but by the time he made it out the object was out of sight below the tree line. As I was walking back to the house I looked and and saw another similar light. I said &quot;Look another one.&quot;  It traveled in the same direction, at the same speed. I got a good look at this one with the binoculars and saw no flashing lights, the vague, black silhoutte against the moonlit sky.  I saw both lights for approximately 15 to 20 seconds each.  They traveled in a straight line, again no sound that I could detect.  At about 10:02 pm I hear two more explosions about twenty seconds apart.  I have no idea what the loud booms were. Fireworks maybe, from nearby casinos.  There was nothing on the local news to explain the loud booms.  And, I have no reason to believe that they were associated with the flying objects.  Just a strange coincidence.
19790315	19980312	 Woodinville (N.E. 189th Street), WA	 light	less than 60 sec.	In 1979, a large circular light was seen over the neighbors house behind N.E. 189th Street in Woodinville.
19970415	19980515	 South Point, OH	 egg	10 minutes	I and a co-worker were traveling on Route 52, just past the bridge into Ashland, Kentucky.  A large, silent, matte silver object appeared in our view approx. 200ft. in sky.  Hovered stationary and then moved very quickly away. It made a triangular pattern over the Ohio River and then went out of view.I described the object as egg shaped but in reality it was more like a large, blunt-tipped diamond shape.  We both agree on the events as they occurered, but my co-worker refuses to discuss the incident.  I remember us talking that day in amazement that no one was pulled off the road gaping at the object as it was quite large and mesmerizing. The object was matte silver, almost like pewter.  There was a glint from the sun but we could not see any features on the object.  It moved away so quickly that I did not notice it was moving, only &quot;getting harder to see&quot;.  We both agree that we had never seen anything like this before and that there was no easy explanation for it.  Another thing we thought strange was the time of day - around 1:00 pm, on a beautiful sunny day.  We are both social workers who work with troubled youth.  One last detail, I experienced no fear when viewing the object but weeks afterward became very fearful and &quot;paranoid&quot; about ufo&apos;s, aliens, etc.  (This is definitely NOT a typical baseline ideation for me!)Partially, this effect is still present which is why I don&apos;t think I can provide any contact information.
19951219	19980201	 Joliet, IL	 oval	10 mins	Summary : 2 objects seen in clear sky hovering. seen while driving E on US 30. Object 1 appeared to &apos;float&apos; around object 2. Glint from top of one attracted attention.2 objects appeared to be floating or hovering in the eastern sky. Approximate angular size was .1 degree. objects had a dull aluminum color on top. Bottom was solid black. Top was a little more deformed than a perfect circle, bottom also. one object was glinting the sun off the top of it, the other was hovering below it by approx 1 degree. Objects were observed for a period of travel of about 8 miles down US 30. Upon turning the went behind a large oak tree and then were unable to be located.

19970701	19980313	 Albion, PA	 cigar	15 minutes	Was silent, seen by two customers of mine, who are not UFO buffswas moving very slowly (no more than 2 mph) made no sound (I have seen blimps they can be heard for miles) was approx 1000 feet long was approx 1 to 2 miles away was definitely not a blimp, sky was clear no clouds was watched by two people for 15 minutes was seen to the west moving north I am not sure the two people who saw it would want to have their names released since one owns a business and does not need to be perceived as a nut They told me the day they saw it since they know I am very interested in UFOs. I was not sure I should report this because I did not see it personally
19980529	19980529	 Maple Shade, NJ	 sphere	20 seconds	Thought it was the North Star. Same brightness, color and size. Moved east to north in the NE sky about 60 deg. above the horizon.Object resembled the same size, color, and brightness as the North Star. About 60 deg. above the North East horizon. Object moved East to North at a slow pace. Like that of a high flying aircraft. It then appeared to ascend at a very high speed until the brightness diminished and then it disapeared.  The sky was clear. I&apos;ve seen many a meteor as well as the space shuttle. I know it was neither nor an airplane.. I have 20/20 vision. I am the only one who saw this object. My belief in UFO&apos;s has been neutral. I had to see one to believe in their existance..
19980216	19980217	 Auburn, WA	 fireball	30 seconds	It was a clear night, we saw a bright goldenrod colored ball in the sky then it split into two balls aprox the same size and shape traveling nose to tail across the sky from north, north east to south, southwest. it maintained shape, speed and form, untill it went out of sight behind some trees.  THey were each, aprox the 1/6 size of the moon. They were traveling about the speed of a commerciall jet, aprox 1000 ft in the air.It was a very clear night, and out of no where came a very bright singular orangish yellow ball.  Then, as if another came from its side another appeared and followed behind the first one.   The stayed the same size and shape and then veared off to the west in a slow arch.  We walked and followed the objects trying to watch them as they went behind some large pine trees. From there we lost sight of them. Backgrounds of observers... one is a computer graphics artist and works for the telephone company as a cable splicer. The second is a sales supervisor for an ISP provider. The Third person works for the airlines as a ticket person.

19850615	19980319	 Kalamazoo, MI		&gt; 2 hrs	Left Dearborn with my daughters at 15:00 driving I-94W to Kalamzoo.  It was a sunny day.  Approximately 10 minutes from Westnedge exit a thick gray cover enveloped the car.  Could not see any cars, brake lights, and no sound of cars colliding.  The gray covering left and all of the cars were facing in various directions.  There were no accidents.  We all straighted our cars out and left.  When I arrived at my friends house they were outside wait for us.  I had called before leaving at 15:00 and they expected us at about 17:15.  They said they were worried because it was after 19:00.  That&apos;s when I noticed the sun was lower in the sky.  This has been bothering me for 13 years.  How can this happen during rush hour and on an freeway?  I feel a need to try and locate some of those people to talk with them, but have no idea how to do so.
19980124	19980129	 San Bernardino, CA	 sphere	30 minutes	Summary : Around 9:30 p.m. 1/24/98 I open my front door, to let my Son in. I notice behind him 3  huge balls of lights coming toward us. (They were the color of what the sun would look like at sun rise). They kept coming close I said  ufo&apos;s before my son turned around he thought I was kidding. But when he saw them he said &quot;what the hell. He got his camera to take pictures. I went across the street to tell my neighbor, she got her camera and also took photos also her children where also watching the 3 strange balls of lights. Then my son&apos;s friend drove up in his car and also watch the lights do movements in the sky. When my son and I frist saw them I was terrified I actually thoght it was the end of the world, because they looked so big, perfect circles of lights. As soon as they went higher in the night skys I felt more at ease. One of the lights went to the east and then disapear the other two stayed side by side then they also disapear without a trace. I have never seen anything like that nor has my neighbor, or my son nor his friend. Also that night I called  the sheriff dept to see if anyone reported these strange objects in the sky, nobody did and I contacted a T.V. station nobody reported anything and nothing his been reported in the local paper.3 balls of lights the color is like when the sun rises in the morning. The night was clear.  They where huge like 3 full moon coming towards me and my son. They where coming from the south of the sky. Then they stayed above my house for awhile moveing around  then they went higher in the sky, one of the ball of light went east the two other stayed south the one in the east disapear without a trace then a jet or airplane was going towards the other two then they disapear. There was 6 witness to this event . My son took a whole roll of film and there is nothin on the film. My neighbors photots of the object is also blank.
19980414	19980428	 Texico, IL	 other	5minutes	a boomerang shaped flying object with numerous lights was seen hoveringreturning home from town,approximately 9:30 p.m. on april 14 1998,my wife and two children(ages 17 and 13) noticed a bright lightin the sky. they saw the light when they were about 3/4 of a mile from our home. they watched it and it appeared to get brighter as they got closer to home.when they approached the house they said it was hovering stationary over our house. they pulled into our driveway and stopped.  Then the object started to move south and passed directly over them slowly.My son ran in and told me ther was a ufo outside. I ran out side and saw it then .by then it was about 400-500 feet south of the house. we watched it continue south maybe 1/4 mile and it turned west. Note as strange as this might sound,this is the third encounter like this I have had. once about 1968, once in 1974, and this current one. Could you tell me if other people have had numerous close sightings? and if there were any other reportings on april 14 1998? It traveled maybe a mile or so and then we lost sight of it.I took my family inside and one at a time had each one draw a picture and give me a discription of the object. they were seperated when they gave me this imformation yet all discriptions were alike. the object was 75-100 feet above the ground approximately 30 feet wide, boomerang shaped,numerous lights on the bottom (blue,red,pinkish yellow), two brights lights on the front which you could&apos;nt see from the bottom. It was dark in color,no shine. it was silent. When they first saw it it was hovering,then when they stopped and got out it was moving at a walking pace,and faster as it left.
19980601	19980925	 Bayfield (near, Lake Superior, south shore), WI	 fireball	5 sec.	white/green ball with trailing tail and falling debris -slow movingI have been a MUFON Investigator, and am an Electrical Eng. and Sailor of Lake Superior with 30 years experience. Ball of light at approximately 2,000ft. (under clouds). It moved at a percieved rate of about 1 inch/sec. as I saw it. White ball turning greenish towards end. It had a long thin trail, but the curious thing was that it dropped debris as it flew by. This debris was a constant curtain of burning material that decreased to the rear of the ball. There was no sound. It appeared that the object was a low-mass object..it&apos;s speed did not seem right for the size etc. After a 5 sec. period, it simply blinked out..and the falling material actually continued for less than a second after it blinked out.
19980615	19980615	 Kingsville, TX	 light	1 minute	Star like object that appeared moving slowly due south then increased speed.  Did not change direction.While walking in Dick Kleberg County park at 0547 spotted an object that looked at first like a star that was stationary, then began to move at first slowly then increased speed.  It was too far away to judge speed, but I first spotted the object at about 45 degrees looking due west and it dissappeared at about 110 degree, the event lasting about a minute.  Object gave appearce of a star, whitish in color, but did not twinkle, no blinking, more like the reflection of light from an object sufficiently high in the atmosphere reflect sunlight despite that it was still very dark in the park.  I have walked in the park for the last 18 months from 0530 to 0630 and have essentially identified all the air traffic that flies overhead from the airports in the vicinity, and this object was a new object and did not appear to be an aircraft.
19980307	19980315	 Lake Placid, FL	 light	3 minutes	Two round, yellow, hazy lights. Smaller than full moon. Came toward us from the east. Sky was clear.  Light on left slightly lower altitude. Right light made circular move to the left in direction of left light. Then turned and rapidly gained altitude until it went out of sight. Left light acted independently. Maintained relative position to right light and followed it up out of sight. Witnessed by two ladies in the courtyard of Lake Blue Resort Condominiums in Lake Placid, FL and male firefighter in Ft. Myers FL All 3 have observed rocket launches from Cape many times. Definetely  not a rocket..((NUFORC:  Missile launch.))
19980923	19980923	 Bothell, WA	 fireball	5 seconds	Viewed a brightly green shooting-star like fireball. It started about in the southeast sky at a downward angle and traveled west before it disappeared.My wife went out to walk the dog at 8:50 PM on Wednesday, September 23, 1998 in Bothell, WA. Right around 9:10 PM we were walking in a SE direction when I noticed a bright light in the sky but partially obscured by a tree. The light appeared to be about the size and brightness of (Jupiter?), the bright planet currently visible in the southward sky, but pale green in color. I soon noticed the light moving toward Seattle (west) and at a downward angle. I told my wife to look. We both witnessed it as it streaked into full view for about three more seconds. The light appeard to get bigger and brighter as it moved and had a small orange-red tail. The largest the light ever got was about the size of an eraser held at arms length. It seemed to disappear or burn out about 30 degrees in the horizon. My wife&apos;s first thought was that it was a firework because of its color and brightness. I believed it was too far and too low in the horizon plus moved too far and fast to a Roman Candle. It basically looked like a very bright shooting star - but green.
19980422	19980422	 Melbourne (looking in the SE sky, perhaps over Bahama), FL	 light	10 seconds	I saw an object which I thought was a bright planet (I see every morning as I deliver newspapers). Instantly realizing the object was too large, and not placed where the planet usually is (lately). I have lived in East Central Florida for 40 years and have seen hundreds of launches from Cape Canaveral. Using those sights as a reference, I saw this object zoom into space at a speed very much faster than any spacecraft I&apos;ve seen.
19980327	19980327	 Milwaukee, WI	 circle	10 min	Light spotted moving very fast heading NE and quickly turning W. Other simular round lights seen w/ same characteristics. Objects moved to fast and silently to be planes.Myself and two friends witnessed a strange light moving North East very fast. The object was moving very quietly. It then turned very sharply twards the West. About a minute later we witnessed another object, which seemed to come out of nowhere heading North East. It was also moving fast and quietly. It turned sharply to the North and quickly faded. Another minute later we saw a light come from the North and quickly turn East a fade like the other lights. About 30 seconds later we saw another quickly moving object come from the North West and then fade. I am 13 and my friends are 13 and 14. I hope you won&apos;t use that against us. There usually aren&apos;t many planes around.
19980422	19980423	 Sierra Vista, AZ	 light	3 hours	We saw two large lights in the sky against the mountain over Fort Huachuca. One was red and flashed one was white.The lights were directly west, immediatly infront of the mountain about 3/4 up the height of the mountain. They were stationary for about two hours the moved slighly north.  We looked with binoculars but could not see any thing more than the two lights.  The aerostat was up that night and was beside us to the south and plainly visable with its flashing white light.  We observed the lights from our porch until we went to bed about 2300.  I thought I could see at times a white beam of light emitting from the red light.  My son thinks the beams might have been only glare because we could not see them when viewing through the binoculars.  We both wear glasses.  There was no other airial activity at that time.  We have had other experiences before but never have  told anyone.  The  thing  that upset my family is that when we returned inside and  got busy doing other things I  suddenly had a severe nosebleed.  We are leaving here late Saturday night moving to another state so we cannot be contacted by e mail or phone after Sat.
19951208	19980218	 Pacific Northwest - flying from Portland to L.A., Ca/Or,	 changing	45 minutes	While flying from Portland oregon to Burbank, Ca. - saw a solid bright light alongside aircraft for about 45 minutes. Object would change shape and size and brightness/intensity. Also would change colors - white, red, orange, yellowish - no specific pattern/no consistency. Light got smaller and smaller and faded away.While flying from Portland Or. to Burbank, Ca. I noticed a white light outside the aircraft.  It did not resemble another aircraft - no strobes or consistant light patterns. This was just one light - which would change shape (from large ball to a much smaller defined point of light). Object seemed to fly alongside our plane for about 45 minutes.  It was really fascinating and as it changed shape it would also fade in and out of different colors. It went through shades of red, orange, yellow, and very bright white.  This whole time I could see other aircraft along other routes and this object did not resemble or act like any of them and it was not a planet or star (too low on horizon).  It always seemed to stay a consistant distance (hard to judge because it was so dark) yet it would morph into these different shape/color phases. The patterns of color and shape were not consistent and differed throughout the whole time.  I asked the person ahead of me on the plane if they could see it - they acknowledged they could and I told them to watch it for a while.  I noticed that person looking out at it occasionally yet they never said anything about it. Eventually the light seemed to start getting smaller and smaller (like a pinpoint of light) and it eventually disappeared - as if turned off!  It was really quite interesting and I am happy to have witnessed something like that. I have flown many times at night and have NEVER seen anything like that. It behaved like no aircraft I have ever flown on or seen while flying - it was really quite amazing!

19980101	19980129	 St. Louis, MO	 flash		Summary : I was watching TV in my bedroom.  It was about to doze off when out my window I saw a very large blue flash.  The flash filled my room and I could see everything as clear as day.  I remember looking at the clock just before it went out. It read 12:58.  All the power in my house went off, then on.  The flash lasted about 15 seconds from the time it came and went.The flash was so bright it appeared to be coming out of my own backyard.  The four other people who witnessed it were outside and say the flash filled the sky.
19980418	19980429	 Glenview, IL	 triangle	10 min	We were watching a movie when one of my freind saw something out of the window. he called all of us over to look at it. A couple days later when I was at school, someone did a UFO project and had a picture of almost exactly what we saw.It was tiangular with rounded corners. It had 3 white lights in each corner and then three orange smaller lights surrounding a white light.It basically hovered and then shot into a white blur. It also had  a whitish glow around it.
19980522	19980523	 Indianapolis, IN	 changing	5 min.	I and my framing crew witnessed this together.We are framing a house on the north side of Indy. Alot of air trafic is going on this day.Blimps ,old planes. etc.I saw a comm. jet and then a strange shape above it. No wings could be seen,but it was moving as fast as the jet in a cross pattern.It then seemed to tumble or twist as it moved apearing to change shapes.Also a faint circle appeared around it.Everyone there witnessed the same things.It moved northeast as fast as a jet.(oppisite jet stream)The clouds had just cleared after a brief afternoon shower. Some clouds still remained but they were more of a high cirus type.The object was almost black in color, and at first seemed to be a large egg.I grew up around airplanes,my brother was an airforce pilot witch we would go see often as I was growing up. So I like to think of my self a semi pro spotter and identifer.Many military planes fly around this area so I show off and tell people what they are easily.I said look theres a Stealth,no what the hell is that!!!  We all saw this shape then tumble or turn so that a single point became clear then gone ,then it was there then it wasnt.It moved to fast to be a balloon and it was heading into the jet stream and the wind.   I KNOW WHAT I SAW  BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT I SAW!!! This object was unidentifiable to anny of us.No one knew exactly what to do or say.The only thing that makes me doubt my siting is that it never changed course.  Iwish it did then I would be sure.

19980923	19980923	 Victoria (Canada), BC	 fireball	5 seconds	A bright green fireball witnessed by my son and I at around 9:10pm local timeAs we drove down the Pat Bay Highway, north of Victoria, at around 9:10 pm local time we witnessed one bright green fireball, approximate size - 1/4 moon, streak across the sky in an east to west direction over the Olympic Mts. The fireball was on a slightly downward course for the duration of time in which the object was visible (5 seconds). It disappeared in what seemed to be mid-air. There were no viewing obstructions as the particular area was flat farm land. There was a long white tail following the object. From past experiences witnessing meteorites we are quite positive in saying that the object seen tonight was not such space debris. I am a government employee with the B.C Ministry of Forests (Victoria branch) and I am currently the president of our local soccer association. My son is 19 years old and currently employed with a local restaurant. I am 48. I hope this is helpful.
19980215	19980524	 Newborough (VIC, Australia),	 triangle	half an hour	a large triangle with orange lights on each of the three corners
19980123	19980331	 Alberton, MT	 circle	1hr	Seen blinking in and out, over the mountains overhead.  No sound came from it.  It stayed in the air for about an hour moving around.  Then blinked out and was gone.  The craft was circle shaped and had red,blue and white lights blinking around it.  No longer visible when blinkedout.
19901216	19980308	 Blocker, OK	 cigar	10 min	6 Deputys at roadblock see object in level flight with large exhaust trail,explosion near nose of craft sends multiple smaller objects streaking to ground.On the above date and time, myself and 5 other deputys were working a drivers&apos; license check at the main intersection of a small rural community in our county.I had just released a motorist to go on his way when I heard one of the deputys exclaim,&quot;What the hell is that!&quot; I turned to face him and looked in the direction he was looking, which was to our northwest. It was not hard to see what he was looking at. I observed an object whose shape was hard to determine at first, as it appeared to be coming almost straight at us. I did easily notice the long trail of exhaust and flame that trailed the object. The object progressed rather slowly, about normal aircraft speed, from our northwest(right), to eventuaslly end up to our southeast(left). As the objectbecame closer and crossed our field of vision, a shape could be better made out. At first, a couple of us thought it might be an airliner that was on fire, but we could not make out any wings or tail structure. The glow from the trail of fire was illuminating the rear of the object somewhat. It should be noted that this sighting occured on a cloudless night with a 3/4 moon in the western sky, many stars visible, and a very clear view as we were far away from any city lights. When the object crossed between our position and the moon in the west, we could discern a cigar-like shape, reminiscent to me of a large missile(icbm type). The others present were in agreement as to the shape of the craft. At a point where the object was moving away to the southeast, but still mostly in front of us, we observed a very bright and instantaneous explosion near the &quot;nose&quot; of the object, immediately followed by approx. ten small objects which streaked toward the ground in a fan pattern, disapperaing in the proverbial&quot;twinkling of an eye&quot;. In fact, if we had blinked, I&apos;m sure we would have missed them, they moved so fast. At that point, a couple of us were saying our prayers and waiting for the blinding flash and mushroom cloud. The closest thing I could think of to describe what I was seeing was an icbm that had just MIRV&apos;ed. There was fortunately no explosion, much to our surprise and relief. We continued to watch the main object progress in controlled flight, to the southeast fo our position, until it finally became nothing but an orange circle of light, as if we were now looking straight at the rear end of the thing. We continued to watch the object until we could no longer see any sign of it. It flew out of our sight. It did not explode, blink out, disappear, or streak off at an unbelievable rate of speed. Once we rgained our composure, I radioed the sheriffs&apos; office and asked the dispatcher to call the FAA Flight Control Center in McAlester. He asked me what was going on because he was already getting calls from citizens around the county who had also seen the object. He called the FAA and they had no report of any scheduled aircraft or any aircraft at all for our area. Within a few minutes, the dispatcher advised me he had received a teletype over the state law enforcement net of the report of an object that landed in a farmers field near Anadarko,Ok.(approx. 130 miles west of McAlester.), and that personnel from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City were enroute to see what it was. That was the last we heard about this until the next day. I channel surfed the news all day long, checking for any mention of this incident, to no avail. Of the seven separate news stations we had available, not one mentioned anything until 1730 that evening when KOCO channel 5 in OKC made a statement that if you saw a bright light in the sky the night before and wondered what it was, you were not alone. They claimed officials at Tinker had no idea what it was either. At a second newscast on this same channel 30 minutes later, in fact, during the weather portion of the broadcast, the weatherman stated that officials at Tinker had determined that what we saw was a Russian &quot;booster rocket&quot; re-entering the earthe&apos;s atmosphere and burning up due to friction. Well, I&apos;m no &quot;rocket scientist&quot;(pun intended), but what I saw was on a perfectly level trajectory(horizontal) with no angle. There was definitely a large streak of flame behind the object, but it was emanating from the rear of the craft, not the nose as you would expect if the flame was caused by friction. The craft was not on fire, it was under propulsion. No other mention of this incident was ever heard by me. Those of us who saw it don&apos;t talk about it anymore. I still have video of the few seconds KOCO devoted to it though.
19780106	19980210	 Westport (about 10 miles North of, US Hwy.1), CA	 other	15 min	Three humongus craft with about 30 saucers about them loading and unloading something.I was stuck at Usal Beach (on the road going out to US Hwy 1) after finally getting unstuck and traveling to Hwy, 1 I went South and at the top of the hill just before going down to the ocean I stopped to have a ciggarette and let my friend behind me catch up. When he did catch up he got into the cab of my truck and we talked a bit trying to decide where we would camp for the night.  We decided on Union Landing, about 2 miles above Westport on Hwy 1.  While setting there alongside the road I noticed a blue light like electric arc welding flashes in the trees ahead.  I thought another fisherman was up late working on his boat.  Upon finishing my smoke we pulled out onto the road and started down towards the beach and union landing.  When I came to a point abreast of where the lights were I looked over to see what kind of a boat etc. the supposed fisherman was working on.  There was no boat, no house, garage or anything else.  The terrain dropped off steeply and I had a view of the ocean.  I was up about 800 feet above the ocean and looking out at one hell of a sight:  3 large ufo&apos;s, each big enough to put the Kibby Dome in (the Kibby Dome is a Football Stadium at The University of Idaho at Moscow, Idaho) as I said there were 3 of them they were the shape of a childs top or a beet.  They were staggered one in front of me another further out and to the right and the third to the left of the first two and further out still.  From my position on the Highway the first was a mile from me the second aboutthree miles out and the fourth about five miles out from me.  I saw two or three white light saucers to the left of the first big ship.  The second ship had none or maybe one about it but the third big ship had about thirty saucers around it.  The big ships were outlined with pink lights and the saucers were solid white light colored.  What was happening as far as I could determine was that the saucers were taking turns going into the bigger craft, one would come out and another from outside would go in.  I watc! hed this for about 15 minutes, all the time trying to describe to myself what they looked like and what it was they were doing.  Finally I got into my truck and went the 5 or so miles to the ocean(the road wound down to the place where it followed the contour of the ocean).  Upon arriving at the ocean I could not see the UFO&apos;S at all.  They had left.  I then continued on down Hwy. 1 to Union Landing where I made camp and stayed for 30 days.  The next morrning we saw 1 or2 F-4 Phantoms flying at about 100 feet elevation and going up the coast.  They were very close to the coast, 1/4 to 1/2 mile.
19980226	19980311	 Ontario, NY	 disk	5 seconds	from rt. 104 looking north saw bright orange light that faded away into a clear starlit night. traveling north toward lake ontario saw three bright orange lights,lighting up a saucer shaped object. 1/2 mile away.the object was about 1/2 mile away and 1/4 mile high and appeared at first as three big, bright, orange lights around a saucer shaped &quot;something&quot;. The lights got very bright and then slowly faded away. My husband pulled over and rolled down the window but we heard no sound.About 5 min. later we saw the single bright orange light farther out over lake Ontario and to the east. That too slowly faded away.There were no clouds in the sky this night.
19970909	19980313	 Roseburg, OR	 light	2 hours	Light bouncing around a valley. Light changes intensity, brightness, and color.  Disappears, reappears different location.On 9/9/97 at about 9:30 p.m., a friend and myself were watching the most severe thunderstorm to hit our area that summer. Shortly into our weather session, my friend says, &quot;hey, do you see that?&quot;.  I looked where he was pointing.  The object was zipping into this valley about 5 miles away to our wnw.  We were located about 10 miles nw of Roseburg OR., USA. The object would be real dim, then brighten intensly, brighter than Venus, but pulsing also, sometimes every color of the rainbow, it seemed.  At one point, the light went down out of sight, then a pause, then it came shooting up out of the valley like a squiggly glowing red sperm, then disappear. Then it would reappear from somewhere else, moving a different direction. Keep in mind, a pretty violent thunderstorm is blasting lightning down, rather close to us at times.  This object was below the cloud deck. At one point it appeared to come very close to us, I swear, I could makeout some sort of lighted window panes, with a darker one in between. I assumed the object was close at that point, possibly within a few hundred yards.  In any case it must have been rather small, perhaps less than 15 meters in size. Well, this went on for about 1.5 hours and we simply weren&apos;t watching the lightning anymore, we didn&apos;t even care that it was getting within 10 miles of us. Ok your thinking, ball lightning right. No.  I would have settled for that, but then something remarkable happened. my friend was looking around for the onject to reappear somewhere else, like it was doing, then I saw it, a perfect white cone of light beaming accross the bottom of the thunderclouds.  There was very little thunder, and no rain at our location, and we could hear no aircraft of any kind. This &quot;spotlight&quot; came from the object, which had reappeared again. I yelled to my friend, but it disappeared just then.  It happened again, and we both saw it. This time, the object was near us and it beamed that perfect white light right above our heads about 100 feet and &quot;scanned&quot; the hillside right behind us. I have been an amateur astronomer and weather observer for well over 15 years, and I have never witnessed an event like this, in fact I have to say, it has been the most troubling event in my life. I also want to point out, at one time it appeared that the one object went into the valley, then came out with another one attached by, &quot;energy&quot; Something strange out there, and I think these strong storms have an adverse affect on them.
19831025	19980216	 California Valley (cattle country, not too distant airbase), CA	 disk	+5 min.	Played with our car for over 5 min. deserted freeway, took off like slingshot returned and put bright light on car, only time made noise.Lady friend asked about funny lights in distance, I joked &quot;it&apos;s a ufo&quot; less than half min it was on us she said &quot;don&apos;t look now it&apos;s right behind us&quot;. I turned to see variable glowing dayglow green disc following pulled up alongside (way too close to mistake for less than genuine) and did some flying stunts for about 5 min.  Way strange, made all my hairs stand on end literally.  Reappeared and threw extra bright light on car, flying in front of us same speed, only time it made any noise.  We both waved hi heartily at it at this time, me feeling a sense of inner peace that there could or must well be life elsewhere, having somewhat Saganistic &quot;skeptic&quot; belief before.  Light and noise from under craft diminished in intensity then took off like slingshot again.  We stopped in first rest area, after passing airbase I believe and French man was running around jabbering about a &quot;phenomena fantastique&quot;. Lady frind drew nice picture of it.  I think it put bright light so it could make movies maybe.  Have wondered if other sightings were reported same areas, times.  I think it was &quot;curious of us as we were of it&quot;. Have no idea what they have about cattle.  It was about 2.5 Lincoln continintal cars long, as I remember. Since then it seems way too many people/friends have ufo stories, including DeForrest Kelley and Jerry Garcia.  It &quot;floated&quot; noislessly while it played with us, noise grew when bottom opened and light started to grow too.  It flew close, like a lane and a half away on mostly deserted freeway due to strange weather patterns before they cleared and the time of night, saw maybe 3 trucks whole time until made rest stop.  Please email if additional data is needed, this is no joke.

19950202	19980522	 Unidentified object sig, (VIC, Australia),	 light	15 minutes	Irregular movement of star shape/intensity objectAn object the size and brightness of a big star flashed irregulary at a rate of once every 2 seconds. It seemed to randomly move around in a 5 degrees. I watched it until I fell asleep, but can&apos;t explain it. I do a lot of skydiving, and have watched planes and things in the sky a lot, and I can&apos;t explain this one. Girlfriend was with me and confirmed sighting.
19980206	19980211	 Webster, TX	 light	5 Mins.	Circular pulsating lights approximately 1 mile in distance from observers.My son and I were in the backyard throwing the football.  My son noticed two pulsing bright white objects approximately one mile away.  They were located low on the horizon and were less than four inches apart when meaured at arms length.  The lights emitted charateristics not common to any aircraft or object previously known to us.  The light was circular with a definite edge, not diffused. We were not able to see any form or shape of the object emitting the lights.  The lights were arranged horizontally, pulsing on and off  but not at the same time.  Alternately, the lights would pulse vertically, diagonally and then return to the horizontal.  This was repeated with no apparent pattern.  When we would move, the lights would move in the same direction.  The objects seemed to move slowly across the horizon then away from us, leaving in a rapid fashion.  As they moved away, they continued to pulsate, sometimes closely together, and other times far apart.  All at once, they disappeared.  We were both very excited/scared for a few hours after this incident occurred, and had a rough time sleeping that night.
19940401	19980521	 Faribault, MN	 fireball	3-4 sec	Observed a green fireball flying 30 ft above and along a river. It flew parallel to the terrain and emitted a long tall w/smoke &amp; sparks.Stepped outside to have a smoke break from work. Was looking so. when a green light suddenly flashed on over the Straight River. The fireball was close enuf to light the tops of the trees on either side of the river. It travelled very slowly and parallel..so slow I expected it to fall down..but it didn&apos;t. The color was flouescent green and despite it being night I could see thick smoke trailing as well as a shower of sparks.  It was completely silent. After 2 seconds or so it suddenly just blinked off. I have not reported this in the past since there was nowhere to report to. thanks.
19980314	19980318	 Tacoma, WA	 fireball	1 to 5 min	My mother saw this, she said it came from the north towards her as she was inside looking out her window.  It was a large RED FIRE BALL, the size was four times bigger than her fist (with arm out) and it hovered over the area (she assumes would be over the North part of the Port of Tacoma, went to get Dad- came back it was gone.  She has always been a sceptic of these things - can&apos;t believe her eyes. Says over and over it was a huge red fire ball and just hovered in the sky over the sound.same info as above.   My mother is 66 yrs old and has been married for 48 yrs and does not see things, a very old-fashion up to date type of person - very truthful.  When she did see this, it appeared as a dot and grew in size as if approaching her way (it was heading south)from the north (looking towards Point Defiance - from her view)She lives next to the fairway of Highland Hill Golf Course, so she had a good view of the sky.
0000	19980311	 Chandler, AZ	 sphere	1/2 hour	small sphere traveling across sky shot up into clouds and disappearedI was in my backyard, talking to my father on the phone. I looked toward the western sky, because my dad wanted to know if it looked like it was going to rain.(He lives in Tucson which is 100 miles from my house) I noticed a small object headed toward me, which means it was headed east. It was about 5-6 feet in diameter. It had a dark reddish gray color. It was not luminous. It was traveling slow about 50-60 mph. The sphere did not jerk while it was flying. It flew in a very straight line toward my house. It appeared to be 400-500 ft high. There was no wind so it was not a balloon.  It turned north in a 45 degree angle about
19940516	19980518	 Nixon, TX	 disk		It was late at night and we were waiting for a friend to come out of a house. While we were waiting we saw the object appear from our east.It was a late night and we were listening to the radio when we saw the object appear from our east. I had seen the object first and told my friend who was sitting next to me to look. We were both very scared and could not move.At first we thought it was a hellicopter, but then we noticed there was no sound. As it grew nearer it was sphere looking object with 6 red lights in a circle.It then passed directly over us and went real slow, it was only about 50 to 60 yards above us, and then it passed to the west.It then went over the trees until we could not see it any more, then it went up so fast all it did was leave a streak in the sky.At that time my friend we were waiting for showed up and his face was as white as a ghost, and asked us frieghtenly &quot;did yall see that and jumped in the truck and we took off. This is the first time eather of us has talked about it. It was a night I&apos;ll never forget  as long as I live.
19980326	19980419	 Poseyville, IN	 oval	50 seconds	I couldn&apos;t tell if it was about ten crafts or one craft with about ten lights. They were tinted red, and have been seen around my town.

It became too dark to ride home, so my friend&apos;s father took me home. While riding in the back of the truck with my friend and his sister. My friend said &quot;Hey look! A UFO!&quot; I thought he was kidding, but when I turned, I realized he really saw something. The object(s) were in a curve, following the pattern of shining, fading, disappearing, and reappearing. The next day at school, I discovered another friend saw it also. Please notify me by e-mail ONLY.

19980227	19980311	 Bellville, OH	 circle	4 hours	Star-like object that pulsed bright red, green and white colors and hovered about one location but made quick short movements.Saw an object, don&apos;t know what it was, on three different occasions.  On or about 2/27/98 it appeared to be the closest.  It looked like a star, but it twinkled more than a star and was brighter than the stars that were out.  The strange thing is that the object appeared to hover in a general location but would make erratic movements in different directions from the central location, about 30 degrees above the horizon looking East. The object never makes a noise and is higher in the sky than any airplanes that pass under it.  The movements are sometimes quick and sometimes slow, but there is definite movement.  The eeriest thing is that when looking through binoculars, you could see bright red, green and white lights that appear to be whirling around the object.  No star does that.  I had 5 witnesses the night that it was closest, and there have been at least two other people see it on 2 other occasions, in the approximate same location.  I am near an observatory, and talking to the operators, the closest thing they can figure is possibly seeing Artuerus.  i plan on filming it the next time I see it on a clear night.  On one occasion, what looked like a shooting star shot out from the object.
19961218	19980313	 The Woodlands, TX	 light	5 minutes	Saw bright orange light (size of Venus)  with diffuse and changing orange haze 1/2 size of moon around central light.I was in the kitchen of my house in The Woodlands, when an odd light in the sky caught my eye. The light was orange colored. I at first thought it might be a dim aircraft landing light. The location is within an approach area of Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH). However, the direction which the light followed was not consistent with approach or departure paths for IAH. I looked at the light through the window and trees, and it seemed to be moving a little erratically as seen through the branches of the pine and hardwoods in the back yard. I grabbed my binoculars and headed outside. Again, the color and intensity of the light was unusual. the binoculars were handy for watching birds at the feeder. I went to a clear area just behind my house, and observed the light with binoculars and naked (I wear glasses) eye. The object continued moving from the East to a point nearly overhead, before changing direction to the North. The night was clear, cool (dry), and moonlit. The time just before 10:00 pm. I did not hear any sound related to the object. I could not estimate the distance to the object. It was not nearby, but could have been any height above, say, 5,000 feet on up to the edge of the atmosphere. I cannot estamte the speed of the object, except to say that it moved from Zenith to Horizon in about 3-4 minutes. The visual size of the central (bright) part of the object was like observing Venus. The color of the object was a golden orange, similar to a dimmed incandescant lamp, and similar to the orange sodium vapor lamps now in commom use for public lighting. The central part was not flashing, but there were some variations in the brightness. Although &quot;bright&quot; I would not characterize the light as &quot;intense&quot;. Around the center bright orange light, was a diffuse halo, or fog, of the same color as the central light, which would expand and contract, sometimes appearing to swirl around the central light. As the object was moving away from me, the intensity of the central light did not seem to diminish, as it would were it a lamp with reflector. There was no other light, nor shadow, nor detail observable with the object. It did seem difficult for me to keep a good focus on the object with either my eyes or the binoculars. The light approached from the East, till nearly overhead, then moved off toward the North, visible for perhaps five minutes before going behind trees to the north, and still visible through those trees until obscured by more dense growth and the northern horizon. This could give some indication of the altitude of the object; were it very high, it should become very small (due to distance) as it nearded the horizon, however, the size did not go very small. Consider a low-flying plane versus one crusing at 35,000 feet as it departs your area. This object appeared more like the low altitude craft as it reached my horizon, even though I could not estimate its height or distance while higher in the sky. The light moved slightly erattically in speed and direction. It did not make any dramatic changes in direction or speed, but did seem to wander around a bit. After I lost view of the object, I stood there contemplating what it was I maight have seen. I observed other aircraft approcahing and departing IAH. These craft were easily identifiable with the naked eye, red, green navigation lights, white beacons and landing lights, even lights on in the passenter cabin.  It was trivial to make out the outline (shadow) of the shape of overflying aircraft against the backdrop of stars and moonlit atmosphere. The orange object seen a minute before shared none of these traits. Every other questionable object I have ever seen in the sky finally resolved into something obviously of local origin... except this one. (end)
19980216	19980216	 Garfield, (VIC, Australia),	 light	1 second	Seen due south of Garfield, lite by sunlight . came direct in vertically. Assumed by us to be debrie, silver or metal to reflex light
19980211	19980212	 Burdett, NY	 other	1 min.	saw group of lights (one craft) over top of trees...when I got past trees, it was goneI assumed it was a plane due to the amount of air traffic in my area, but it had so many lights on it (at least 6-8 that I could see) that it got my attention.  It seemed to be moving at a pace equal to a typical jetliner, but when I got past the trees to get a real good look at it, it was completely gone.  The lights seemed to pulse rather than flash.  Mostly white but some were blue, green, and red.  The area past the trees would&apos;ve given me a perfect view if it was a jet...thusly my curiosity.
19980305	19980306	 Pittsfield, ME	 formation	15 min	one large craft silver spinning and emitting a strange light.  three smaller fireball-like balls moving in random directions around the larger craft.  Missing time by one observer.  Possible abduction.
19940510	19980208	 Frankfort, MI	 unknown	30 minutes	Large flashing light extending down from sky to lake Michigan.Clear evening very little over cast.  Myself and my wife observed a large shatf of light out over lake Michigan.  It looked like a very thick bolt of lightning but continued to pulse about once a second.  It stayed in a genreral area moving back and forth.  It extended down from the sky to the lake and was very bright kind of like a strobe light.  It appeared to be thick in diameter and long given the distance out over the water.  As stated it would flash about once a second and move back and forth in the same general area.  It continued for about 30 minutes when it just stopped.  It did not look like a lighthouse due to the length of it and the way it moved from south to north and back again. I have a brief portion on video that is being sent via mail. I did not film the entire duration unfortunately.
19980225	19980226	 Nashville, TN	 fireball	2 minutes	Unusual Blue Light (Meteorite or Flare) 2 minutes observed traveling south to north.East of Nashville at 20:00 hrs.CST on 25 Feb. 98 a bright blue large evening star appearing in shape and color meteorite or flare or ? traveled at the rate of a Jet airliner from south to north (unusual for meteorite). First observed at approx. overhead position and took two minutes to travel north then dimmed or burned out with no color change or breakup at approx. 10 degrees from northern horizon. Observation made by my wife and myself. I have 17 years affiliation with the Air Force and am a C-5A Galaxy Flight Engineer. We have both observed many falling stars and both agree this was unusual in its bright intensity and blue color and direction of travel from south to north. I am 100% certain about the charactoristics. Also I used an aircraft transitioning along the eastern horizon for speed comparison. This was not an aircraft we observed. Again either a Meteorite transitioning the atmosphere or a flare traveling from south to north.
19980313	19980320	 San Jose, CA	 sphere	15 sec.	At approximately 1:30pm on 3/13/98, a group of seagulls caught my eye. As I looked up at the gulls,I noticed above them at about 4-5 white spheres traveling east to west at about 30 to 40 thousand feet.At approximately 1:30pm on 3/13/98, I was in my backyard when I looked up and noticed a group of seagulls flying over head. Directly above traveling in a east to west direction over San Jose and heading twards the coast I noticed four to five bright spheres. I focused on the birds again to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, then back on the spheres. These objects were white and completely round in shape. No other characteristics were observed.It was hard to tell how fast they were moving. They were traveling in a box formation. One trailing object moved from left to right over another and then moved back to its original position. It was at this time I decided to go in the house a get my binoculars, when I returned they were gone. For the next couple of days I told myself that what I saw could not have been a UFO, but there were no wings, perfectly round and very bright in color. I have not told my family because they would think I was nuts. I had to make this report because I think its important. I know what I saw and they were not planes nor were they baloons. If you are able to find out what these were, I would appreciate it if you would let me know. Thanks, salarussas@msn.com
19890101	19980129	 Wagoner, OK	 light	1-2 mins	Summary : My friend and I who were both 16 at the time were driving to her house on state highway 51 westbound. We were going to be late for curfew so we were in a hurry. there were no cars coming in either direction. We were driving along and something caught my peripheral vision to the north. We saw about 5 or 6 bright lights coming up from the ground behind the tree line they were so bright they looked like spotlights shining straight up into the air. I was freaking out telling her to stop so we could see what that was so we slowed down considerebly then these lights started to turn in a complete circle all at the same time. We were both going Oh my God what the hell is that?!!! Then the lights just started crisscrossing over one another very fast. I was still begging her to stop so we could watch them but she was afraid of getting in trouble for being late for curfew already so we just drove off. I believe this was a ufo on the ground there are no buildings or houses around where this happened only fields and trees a fairly rural area. This is one of the strangest things I have ever seen.I don&apos;t remember the exact date I only remember it was late spring or early summer in 1989 My friend Kristie VanBrunt and myself were driving westbound on highway 51 to her house we were going to be late for curfew and she didnt want to get in trouble. We were just driving along talking and all of a sudden out of the corner of my right eye I see these incredibly bright white lights shining straight up into the sky there were about 5 or 6 of them and they were arranged in a circle the lights were behind the tree line coming up from the ground. I was like WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!! and told my friend to stop the truck so we could see she wouldn&apos;t stop partly out of fear of her parents and the fact she did not know what we were seeing but we did slow down to about 10 miles per hour there were no cars in either direction as far as we could see which was unusual. The lights started to turn around in a big circle  they stayed in their posistion but the whole thing was turning slowly at first then very fast. Then the lights just started going crazy criss crossing each other and we were both just staring with our jaws wide open in disbelief at what we were seeing I started screaming  to stop but she wouldn&apos;t. I am now 24 years old I have 2 children I am a supervisor in a telecommunications center and consider my self very normal. My friend is a homemaker mother of 1. We have not told very many people about this because people look at us like were nuts. Every since then I have had a firm belief in ufos.
19910615	19980616	 Gainesville, FL	 other	3 minutes	Nighttime sighting. UFO was on the ground. Occupant sighted. Did not stay long.This all happened when I was in Job Corps at the Gainesville Job Corps Center. It was dark, and me and one of my good friends had to retrieve something from the woods surrounding the Center (of course, we weren&apos;t allowed in the woods, but we went anyway). We were walking towards where we had our campsite and my friend stopped me suddenly. &quot;Check it out! Two werewolf (?) type beings just floated across!&quot; He shouted. I was looking down at the time, so I cannot acknowledge if he indeed saw this. We continued on when we spotted a UFO on the ground, barely discernable. The shape of it was roughly that of a saucer. It was doing nothing, just sitting there, silent. Strangely, no lights or anything else that could provide illumination was present on, around, or near it. It was more like we could see it since our eyes were adjusted to the dark (Since we didn&apos;t really want to get caught, we had no flashlights). We advanced slowly, hoping to get a closer look at it. No such luck. We stopped in our tracks when we realized it had disappeared! We glanced at each other, and moved on. We got close to where our material was when something compelled me to get out of there and FAST. I took off running and my friend was not too close behind. As I was running, I looked over my shoulder and spotted a tall, dark, large-headed being with a dark robe on and it&apos;s hands folded in front of it. I did not stop to talk to it or get any closer. I just wanted out of there. That&apos;s about it with this one.
19970826	19980223	 Meadow Creek (Canada), BC	 light	20 min	Light in western sky, 2times as bright as a satellite. Changed color as it moved around a very small area of the sky. Erratic movement and very fast for the distance.I was  in Meadow Creek which is in the middle of some of the most rugged ground in B.C.  The brightness and movement of the Light caught my eye. It was extremely fast for what would pass for an extremely bright satellite. The path was not predictable as a satellite is. The whole time I watched it, it never left &quot;Its area&quot;.  The light had a range or area it was flying, very small in the sky.  If you held your hand  outstretched, you could easilly cover the whole area.  The color went from silver- white to pale yellow and occasionally blue. I cotinued to watch for 20 minutes as it darted around . I spend a large amount of time around all types of aircraft,and there is nothing on the books that could do the speeds this object did. It was crysatl clear, no other lights to interfere, as Meadow Creek has a population of about 300. The light was in the western sky quite high off the horizon of mountains. It did not leave, I left,  I had to be up early for work the next morning.  I had just finished work, had not been indulging in anything to deprive my senses.

19980111	19980112	 Cape May, NJ	 light	3 minutes =/-	Summary : What initially appeared to be an aircraft, accelerated away from me at a rate of speed too great to be an aircraft.  At a few miles distant, I observed no object, only a very bright white light.  No fluctuation in intensity, no blinking, no twinkling.  No sound.  Disappearance during a quite glance at my watch to record the time since this was such an unusual event.While standing on the beach at sunup, while still able to see starts, I observed a bright light that I initially considered to be a planet, only much brighter.  Eventually the light starting moving as if an aircraft was traveling towards me and veering away.  It began to accelerate rapidly and disappeared during the time of a quick glance at my watch. There was no sound, no wind. There was a band of clouds on the horizon, although I was able to see stars above me.  It was gradually getting lighter, although the light was distinctively different than a planet or star. There were no other typical hints of it being an aircraft, e.g. extra red light, or blinking light.
19980307	19980309	 Tampa, FL	 other	3 minutes	On the date and time listed above my girlfriend and I saw two unknown objects over the Tampa Bay area. They were appeared to be trapezoidal in shape. The event lasted approximately 3 minutes.On the date and time listed above, my girlfriend and I were travelling from Clearwater, Florida to our home in Tampa. That would place us travelling almost due east.It was approximately 6:45 to 6:50 pm when I noticed these two objects at about 45 degrees above the horizon. The objects were appeared to be trapezoidal in shape...wider at the bottom than at the top.  I asked my girlfriend if she saw what i saw...and she replied that she did.  Since we were heading toward the causeway we had an unobstructed view of these objects.  They appeared to me to be silvery and I asked my girlfriend if they looked to be in a haze and she thought perhaps they were.  I looked up through the sunroof of the car and saw the moon as clear as could be....there was no haze in the sky.  We continued to watch the objects, which appeared to be side by side.  They then separated for a bit, moving very rapidly.  Then after about 3 minutes or so they darted towards the north and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  These objects seemed to be very large.  At first I wondered if they were military aircraft, as we were heading towards McDill AFB in Tampa.  I asked my girlfriend and she agreed with me that neither one of us had seen any aircraft like those and that they seemed to move too fast. I am a 39 year old male with a 20 year sales background.  My girlfriend is 34 and has a 15 year sales background.  We are both college educated.  Neither one had any alcohol prior to our siting.((NUFORC:  probable missile launch.))
19980124	19980124	 Cape Coral, FL	 diamond	40 minutes	Summary : 2 glowing objects seen in the sky with many lights; dimond shaped.  Seen for at least for 30 minutes with photographs taken.Myself, Jarrod R. Drury, and my girlfriend, Heather E. Clugston, first witnessed 2 flying objects in the sky while taking vcr tapes back to the local Blockbuster.  I (Jarrod), immediately did a U-Turn back to my house to grab my camera.  The first contact sighting was at 9:28pm. et.  It was a matter of minutes to get to my house and to get the camera.  We jumped back into the truck, and drove to a clearing where I could park and get a picture.  I took several pictures from there, turned back for my house, and while driving down the street that my house is on, the object rose higher in the air, so I stopped to take a few more pictures.  I was coming back to my house this time, to grab my cam-corder, but when I tried to use it, the battery was dead.  We observed the craft for a few minutes longer, and it travled out of site in a steady, &quot;floating&quot; manor.  We decide to take the tapes back, and as we were driving, we noticed red lights where the craft once was.  We parked to take pictures of this as well, but there was no sign of the craft.  We finally pulled back into the driveway at 10:06 pm. et.  Iam an business advisor, as well as working part time for my parent&apos;s floor care service, and my girlfriend works at a local shipping factory as a receptionist.  I am 20 yrs old, and she is 19.
19980307	19980310	 Lighthouse Point, FL	 light	20 seconds	2 bright white lights with comet like curved fan shaped tails streaming behind, stationary in east sky over ocean,45 degrees above horizon,disappeared completely after small cloud passed in frontOn the night of March 7 1998 in the city of Lighthouse Point Florida at approximatly 6:45 p.m. my nephew and I witnessed 2 bright white small points of light with large elliptcal cometlike tails emitting behind. The light on the left was slightly lower than the one on the right. There was no sound from the objects and they appeared stationary 45 degrees above the horizon. We had seen dozens of small aircraft and large jets before and after this sighting and could hear their engines as well as see the red and green wing lights, the strobes, and the landing headlights. The two objects I am writing about had no colored lights, no flashing strobes, and made no sound. I definitly felt they were nothing I&apos;d ever seen in my 38 years on this earth. A small fast moving cloud ( moving from south to north ) passed in between the objects and us ( no more than 5 seconds ) and when it passed the 2 objects had completely disappeared with no trace. This whole episode lasted between 20 and 30 seconds. I am 38 and live in West Chester Ohio and was vacationing in South Floria the whole week. I have been traveling to South Florida for 20 years and have never seen anything like this before. I am an avid skywatcher and work in the IS department of a major health informaton storage company. My nephew is a 16 year old with a good head on his shoulders. I am dying to know what so many people saw that Saturday night and I&apos;ll never forget what I saw!((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))
19980123	19980123	 Holstein/Heartwell (In country between), NE	 triangle	6 to 7 minutes	Summary : Father and son driving west on Hiway 6, around 6 pm. Glowing object stationary for 6 to 7 minutes. Object turns on end, then turns to show triangle shape with bright light on one end then disappears instantly to the west.I was driving down Hiway 6 heading to Holstein with my son.  We noticed a very bright light ahead in the west.  It was about 6:05pm and the sun had gone down, but the sky was orange and clear with no clouds. We noticed that the object was not moving, there were two jets farther west behind the object, which I used to judge size. The object was very large and was stationary for 6 to 7 minutes.  As we turned south off of Hiway 6 on to the junction road that leads to Holstein we kept our eye on the object, which seem to be turning in place on end, to give it a long shape that look like a long glowing cylinder. Then the object turned again and we could see that it was a triangle shaped object, with a very bright light on one of the points.  We were head for the next gravel intersection road to turn west to watch the object.  We turned right and while we were watching the object, it seemed to dim a bit, then it was gone instantly.  We proceeded down the road further, but there was no sign of anything.  This object seemed to be very large and was definitley triangle shaped from our last view of it.  It was very impressive.  It was not dark out yet, and the sky was clear, so there is no doubt that we saw something very unusual.
19830405	19980217	 Waikiki, HI	 disk	30 seconds	The object was very clear, no haze, no distortions, and silent. It was lighted with multiple colors on its bottom, remeniscent but not identical to the movie close enounters of the third kind. There was no energy phenomenon surrounding it as in that movie. I saw no occupants, and it was gone after a brief time. As it went behind the tower closer to the ocean, I walked down Ohua Avenue crossing this street wishing to see if it were still there behind the building. Going across Kuhio Avenue, I looked but saw nothing. If I had a camera that could have photographed what I saw, I believe it would be the most convincing UFO photograph on record.Since early April 1983 I have been aware by direct experience that we are not alone. On an early evening walk in Waikiki, Honolulu Hawaii, I witnessed a brief encounter with a UFO that appeared quite jeweled. Its multi colored lights and freedom from any sound whatsoever is entered into my own life of perceptions. It appeared right between the twin Banyan Towers on Ohua Avenue, on my left hand side while I walked towards the ocean. Hundreds of people must have had an opportunity to witness this sighting, if anyone looked out their windows. I am hopeful someone will reconfirm my sighting.. I walked ahead after it flew past that tower, and I crossed the street to go around and look for it. It was gone. It was the most vivid impression I have ever had, and the only time in my life I have witnessed the wonder of this apparently extraterrestrial technology. Once you have actually witnessed the phenomenon, you simply cannot believe every debunking of it by the conventional media. If anyone was staying at the Banyan Twin Towers on Ohua Avenue at Kuhio Avenue in April of 1983 please let me know if you also had a sighting. P.S. This is only one experience. It is a wide universe, and the possibilities are open. I also have a notion that some civilizations have progressed socially and even morally along with their gadgets to be emminently proto human. At the same time I note that a great deal of anti-social conduct demonstrates the gravity of science at times outweighing the relationship of any and all sentient beings to one another. Philosophically this is the greatest weakness of social strucutures that may tend to abandon notions of consanguinity inherent to a vital existence. I feel deeply sorry for UFO occupants who exist with such a poverty of social understanding, and even moreso that with all their technology that they are worse than primates in our worst apparent understandings of the term. At the same time I have an intuition that those occupants in my sighting may have been socially adept, even a moral set of civilization.
0000	19980415	 Oklahoma City (northwest of; approximately over Lake Hefner), OK	 cigar	2 minutes	observed a darkred,almost purple,blimp shaped object with a belt of panel-like windows that might have been like bluish lights in them,laterally and circumferentially,located around the middle of the craft.It moved slow like a blimp and was quiet.It moved slowly for a minute or two and suddenly accelerated so quickly that it appeared to just vanish.I walked out the frontdoor of my home to my car to go to work at approximately 0800 hours.I was facing the east.The weather was sunny but with just a few light,scattered clouds.The clouds were no hindrance to visibility.As I proceeded to my car,I looked up to the north-northeast sky and observed a large,purple object (one only) that sent cold chills down my spine.It appeared to be moving very slowly over the southeastern corner of Lake Hefner in a southerly direction and then turning to the southeast.The speed was similar to the speed of a blimp.The altitude was less than 1000 feet.It appeared to be at a distance of approximately no more than 1 to 2 miles.It was completely silent.I was in a state of disbelief or denial about what it might be.I was trying in my mind to tell myself it was something manmade.I also knew for certain that it was not an airplane as I am familiar with the physics of airplane flight due to the type of work I do and who I work for.It would have stalled out as big and slow as it was moving.Next I tryed to tell myself it was a blimp,but I am familiar with say,the GOODYEAR blimp,and it was not that due to the coloring.It had bluish looking panels going around the craft in the middle laterally.They appeared to be flashing to a degree.I wondered if it might be some sort of advertising device on a blimp.I told myself it was very odd looking but beautiful for a blimp.It was very strange because that was the only lights on it.No beacon lights(red,white,or green) were observed that a normal craft would have.As I was observing it`s motion,I yelled for my wife to come outside,which she did.I pointed it out to her and she also saw it,along with my granddaughter,who also observed it.I said &quot;keep an eye on it and I will run back in the house to get a camera&quot;.I did this but could not find the camera.This took no more than 30 seconds.I ran back outside and it had disappeared.I asked,&quot;Where did it go?&quot; My wife said it accelerated so fast it appeared to just disappear.We asked ourselves what coul! d it have been.The complete time of the event was no more than 2 minutes.First,it was definitely not a plane.The HARRIER jet is the only plane I know of that could move like that and it was not in the shape of a plane.Secondly,if it was a blimp,how could it just disappear like that?? I have watched blimps land or accelerate and it takes a little more time to accomplish than the 30 seconds I was in the house.I listened to the radio and checked the newspapers and never heard anyone else report this event.I am at a loss to know what we observed!My background is:Machinist for the U.S.AIRFORCE for 28 years and 53 years old.My wife is a clerk for the OKLAHOMA ((deleted)) and 2 years younger than me.My granddaighter is 8 years old.I dont use any type of alcohol or drugs, nor anyone else in my family.I can report that we all were very sober for this occurrence.I regret not having the date of this event nor any photos of the craft.Also I wished I could have reported the event sooner.I hope that by telling of this occurrence to someone who knows something of UFO`s that it will help me to purge my mind of the frequent question I ask myself:&quot;What did we see?&quot; and I hope that maybe someone may have seen something similar to this somewhere.If you are able to help,I would be very grateful!
19940401	19980110	 Indiana, PA	 disk	3-10 sec	Summary : we saw a saucer shaped object with a halo around it behind it followed three jets with after burners engaged colors appeared to be blue and red. ( The local news (WTAE) out of pittsburgh covered the siting.)
19980510	19980513	 Seattle, WA	 fireball	60 sec	Walking from cruise ship to Space Needle.  What appeared to be a Military flair white light with trailing smoke ?Airplane crash.  Looking out across water
19970906	19980227	 Covington, WA	 triangle	15 min	Triangle shaped with six lights underneath.  One side of the triangle was red, one other side was blue.  Both of these sides had a horizontal string of very bright lights straight through the middle, of strobe brightness.I think I was born with my eyes on the sky.  I have always been fasinated with the stars and planets.  I take my children and grandchildren out to the  yard during summer nights and point out the constellations.  Show them satalights going overhead, explain how regular their orbits are.  We stay up half the night in July/August to observe the meteor shower every year.  My father flew small planes and I grew up at the airport.  We have numerous fly overs from the military with large helicopters and transports, we see lots of police helicopters at night and we&apos;re also in the flight holding pattern for Sea-Tac Airport.  I know what&apos;s up there and I know what it sounds like and I know what it  looks like day or night. The morning of the sighting I got up to use the bathroom and saw the Orion constellation was incredibly bright and beautiful that morning so I stepped out onto our rear deck to view it, as soon as I stepped out onto the deck this object, impossible to miss was hovering directly in front of me at the tree line.  It wasn&apos;t moving and it wasn&apos;t making any sound.   It was about 30 feet in width in direct proportion with the side of a hockey puck.   It was split in precise halves, one side red the other blue, with a string of very bright, strobe bright, lights horizontilly through the center of the object.  It just hung there for some minutes.  It started to slowly move sideways to the west, traversed the width of our little valley and then started gaining altitude, now moving northwest, gaining not more than another30 feet or so in altitude, just enough for me to see it&apos;s underside which was triangular shaped with 6 large lights. One at the front, then two,  then three.  It then changed direction, the point of the triangle headed northwest. I could again see the blue side. It then went out of sight behind a stand of trees.  Before it disappeared I took a picture with my camera but of course it didn&apos;t come out.  I don&apos;t like sounding like a cliche.  This is not my first sighting here from my home.  The last one here was in the winter of 91.  It was about 60 feet across hovering over my neighbors home.  Looked like an inverted gas stove burner.  You could clearly see a metalic ring above the flame but nothing else.   This was at 3:00 A.M. Thought I&apos;d lost my mind or was dreaming and then the next night KOMO TV evening news showed a video of the object taken the night before in Puyallup around 8:30 P.M. Please, I would really like to talk to someone about these things.  By the way I have an I.Q. of 132, I&apos;m not hysterical, easily influenced, or excitable and I&apos;m analitical by nature.  I first check everything off the list it can&apos;t be.
19910501	19980312	 Escondido, CA	 cigar	2 seconds	Saw a blue shaped oblong (cigar shaped) object which was stationary at first and then acclerated  at an incredible speed and disappeared.  It was during the middle of the day.  I saw this object as well as my father.I was travelling in a pick-up truck west bound towards Escondido, California with my father in the spring of 1991.  We were going to install a motion light for my step-grandmother.  We were stopped at an intersection stop light.  An oblong bright blue (cigar shaped) object had appeared in the sky from what seemed out of nowhere.  It was stationary in the sky for perhaps less than a second and then accelerated and disappeared again it what seemed a split second.  When I saw the object appear in the sky, my first reaction was to point at it and comment on it to my father (he is a law enforcement officer)  But before I could even say a word the object had disappeared.  Both of us remained speechless.  After a minute or two I asked him if he had seen the object and what he thought it was.  We were both astonished and speechless which perhaps explains the initial silence.  We had both commented on the bizaar sight and suggested that it had been an UFO. I was quite suprised by my father&apos;s suggestion and acknowlegdement that it may have been an UFO.  We have never spoken a word to one another about it since that day. It just seems too awkward.  What we experienced was very unique. I am now 22 years old.  Born in 1975.  I am a college student considered intelligent ( to most).  I am neither a believer or a disbeliever of UFO&apos;s,  but I am open-minded to the possibility.
19620515	19980425	 Acoma, NM	 cylinder	30min.	On this date my Mother and cousin and I were traveling west on the interstate40 ,between albuquerque and the lava fields outside acoma. as we were traveling My cousin and I observed a light on the horizone. It appeared stationary but was getting brighter.As time went by the light we realized was moving toward us going east. By this time my Mother also saw it and thought it was a plane  that was going to land on the freeway because of trouble. My Mother pulled the car over to the side of the road stopped the car and turned off the engine. As it got closer instead of one bright light there were 4 and it was almost above us. We got out of the car and there was no noise at all no crash nothing it just disappeared.We also realized that the nearest landing strip was approp.90 miles away. Then the light just shot off in a northerly direction. that was the first of many unexplainable lights I saw in the sky. My family is from Az and as kids and later as young adults we would through a sleeping bag down and fall asleep watching ufos.
19980307	19980308	 Lehigh Acres, FL	 fireball	3 min	Two glowing fireball objects with a large afterglow spread out behind them.While traveling east on 23rd street, and then north on BethStacy blvd, observed objects traveling southeast and upwards. It was approximately 6:50 pm. The object on the left was higher on the horizon than the one on the right. About two minutes after the objects were spotted, the one on the left faded out for about two seconds but the afterglow remained. The weather was clear and the skies were blue. It was about dusk. The local news station has a video tape of the sighting. The one on the right faded out before the one on the left.((NUFORC:  Sighting caused by missile launch at sea by U. S. submarine.))
19980412	19980511	 Waldorf, MD	 oval	Unknown	Object appeared in a photograph that was taken Easter Sunday 1998.  None of the 5 persons present during the actual photographing remember seeing the object.  It was not known untill the film was developed a few days later.Myself and a group of friends were shooting off model rockets in the parking lot of West Lake High School here in Waldorf Maryland around 17:00 Easter Sunday 1998.  I snapped this photo of my nextdoor neighbor prepairing another rocket for launch, and when the photo came back from CVS, the object in the upper right hand courner was present.  It appears to be roughly oval in shape with what might be a triangular construction on top.  The triangular region seems to be highly reflective, while the lower oval portion of the overall object is dark and featureless. I have ruled out the possibility of lens contamination, it only appears on the one frame, and there were no rockets in the air at the time, and no other persons in the area.  Noone from the group remembers seeing anything, and we were all suprised by the photo.
19720815	19980518	 Toronto (Canada), ON	 sphere	240 minutes	Witnessed glowing sphere land in middle of urban area, had confirmation from authorities.This took place in the summer of 1972, possibly mid-august, in Toronto Canada.  On summer visit to grandmother&apos;s house there, I and my best friend (teenagers at the time) noted that the dark kitchen was lit up like daylight at 1 a.m... but it was strange orange light... running to window, we saw enormous orange sphere more than six storeys tall landing in an open ravine area beyond local business district, which was visible from the window there. We watched for some time as the craft settled slowly into the clearing beyond apartment buildings 2 blocks away... no sound, but so bright it lit up the whole neighborhood. When it landed, one could still see the top of it over top of the apt blocks (hence estimation of more than 6 storeys tall when landed)... We had NO fear, wanted to go down there and see up close, but grandmother and aunt woke up in our commotion and forbid us to go. Grandmother (a retired school teacher) and Aunt (a CBC television costume designer) saw craft as well as us. Called my parents in California to get my Dad to aid in keeping us girls in the house, he remembers this call. Aunt suggested I call police. Police operator answered and I suddenly lost my voice, didn&apos;t know what to say... stammmered umm umm... she said &quot;you calling from Forest Hill?&quot;  I said I was.  &quot;You calling about the flying saucer&quot; I said I was.  (her words)   &quot;Can you see it now?&quot; I said I could. &quot;Can you see the hi rises from where you are?&quot; I said I could. She then said &quot;Everyone in those hi-rises has already called us.&quot;  She went on to tell me that they were telling people to stay in their houses, and that patrol cars were in the area to investigate. We watched for more than another hour, the craft still visible on the ground beyond the hi rises.  Eventually my aunt made us go to bed. We lay on the floor and listened to Toronto all night talk radio, and all the calls were about the sighting. Eventually we fell asleep on the floor in front of the radio, waking at daybreak, at which point we ran down to the area, and found NO signs of anything. No flattened grass, singed ground, nothing.  We tried to call talk radio and got told that  &quot;they were taking no more calls about flying saucers. Toronto is a busy city and there is lots more important stuff going on.&quot; There was nothing in either newspaper (telegram or star) and we called both newsrooms to be told that reputable papers didn&apos;t bother with silly nonsense like flying saucers. We called the police and were told that the night before there were some reports of some sort of prank in our area (Forest Hill Village - an upper class neighborhood in the middle of the city) but that investigating officers had found no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The Sphere was perfectly round, noiseless, and glowed with an amazing shade of pure clear orange light that entirely lit up the neighborhood bright as day.  It took about 20 minutes to land gently in the field beyond the aprtments. The field is still there 20 years later, between Spadina and Bathhurst, this took place just beyond the intersection of Lonsdale and Spadina in the middle of Forest Hill there... After it landed we could still see the top of it over the buildings between it and us, but with no movement and no sound, after a couple of hours we were almost bored, and frustrated that we were not being allowed out of the house for a closer look. The police operator told me that everyone in these hirises (also visible to us) had called them, she seemed to be caught up in it at the moment, I consider the police operator to have verified this sighting to me. I have filed reports of this sighting with a few other researchers and groups over the years, because I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m the only witness still around, it had to have been seen by many people, the police operator told me their lines were ringing off the hook... (remember in &apos;72 they didn&apos;t have caller ID even at the police station, she ASKED me if I was in Forest Hill) Today I am 41, mother of a teenager, work as the station manager of a local cable company community access television channel here in B.C.&apos;s gulf islands... am college educated, don&apos;t drink or smoke... I know what I saw, remember the entire incident vividly. The aunt and grandmother who saw this with me are dead now, but my father is here and alive and remembers the telephone call from my aunt when my friend (who is traceable) and I were so intent to go outside and get a closer look at this &quot;object&quot;
19980311	19980311	 Kauai (2/miles off north coast of), HI	 sphere	3/MIN,	While fishing off of the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii we saw a metalic sphere moving at a very high rate of speed in a North Westerly direction. The object stayed in view for about three minutes before going out of sight over the horizon.
19980517	19980519	 Belle Vernon, PA	 other	40 min.	Explosion of a bright white very high flying &quot;Torroid&quot; shaped craft.Dear Sirs, Since I assume that you are the agency responsible for monitoring the airspace over North America I would like to report the following. On Sunday evening May 17, 1998 my wife and I and a friend and his wife wittnessed the explosion of what appeared to be a very high flying aircraft.  It was located in a N-NW direction from Belle Vernon, PA at about 70 degrees elevation. We watched the object, which was more of less stationary (we had no real reference), from 8:10 PM until 8:50 PM.  At that time I witnessed the object explode leaving a cloud of debris which consisted of many small fragments and one larger &quot;dark red ball&quot; which a few seconds later, split into two smaller fragments. The general apperance of the aircraft was that of a &quot;glowing torriod&quot; with the center being darker than the outside. If you have any information I would appreciate your letting me know what it was that we saw. Please feel free to E-mail me if you desire additional information regarding the event.
19980130	19980130	 Monroe City (3 miles East of), MO	 fireball	2 seconds	Summary : Saw what I believe was a shooting star or space debris. It came down from North to South. Yellow/ Gold in color with a sparkling gold trail. It burned up before hitting the ground or passing over the horizon. I&apos;m reporting this since I saw the July 4th 1997 event and thought it was local and found out later it was seen in three states.
19980110	19980110	 Bremerton (over), WA	 light	aproximately 5-minutes	Summary : 10-year old sites ufo above Bremerton.  She explains it as a fire in the sky.  The object moved extremyly slow.Approximately @ 5:00pm, Two 10-year old Bremerton girls explained to their mother that there was fire in the sky.  The mother replied with out looking that it was the sun setting.  They kept insisting no.  So I and my signifigant other ran to the window to see a bright light in the sky.  In the south direction.  Possibly over the Lions Park or PSNS base.  I ran back to my bedroom and grabed my binoculars.  I ran out front and looked up into the sky.  I seen to bright yellowish-orangish lights.  They did not appear to be conneceted, but decseding together.  My first thought was meters, but they traveled in unison and extremly slow.  I then tried to get an even better view and at this time they just disappeared.  I have waited to hear of the sighting on the news, but no claims have been made.  Here in Bremerton wondering?! What?!  Although my signifagant other thinks it was meters.  Then why haven&apos;t they been reported??
19970820	19980602	 Lethbridge (Canada), ON	 triangle	15  sec	Flying Object came from the north heading southI took a Garbage bag to the alley when comming back I happend to be looking upward and saw an object comming toward me . It was very low and getting larger fast. It was about 500-800 ft a.g.l. moving from north to south at a very constant speed and heading. as it passed over me I could clearly see three cylinder shaped lights going into the craft with the light being very dull yellowish color. Also as it went over the stars disappered behind it, giving me an outline of its shape. This thing did not make a sound and it did not have any navigation lights. I estimate the size of the object being the same size as a four engine airliner. What really buged me was even if the engines were shut down it was close enough that I should have heard the air rushing around its frame. It went out of sight after about 10-15 seconds and the only thing I could do was verify the time it happend, 11:00 p.m.
19980905	19980924	 Kimball Twp. (5 miles S.W. of Port Huron), MI	 fireball	approx. 5 seconds	I was at my residence when I and two other subjects observed a green fireball proceed from the West to the East. The green fireball was observed to be &quot;very&quot; bright and was observed to have a long tail following the main part of the fireball. I have seen these green fireballs on other incidents but I have never reported any of these observations due to the fact that I thought that they were just meterors.There really is not much more information to say about this observation other than it was a bright green color. The observation was brief as it was moving at a high rate of speed from the West to the East. I&apos;m currently a police officer for a local city police department in St. Clair County, Michigan. I have been a police officer since 1991 and have witnessed one other strange observation way back on 1984 in Livonia Michigan which was also witnessed by two other subjects. The incident was reported in our local newspaper (Livonia Observer and the Detroit News). I can supply dates and times if you are interested. I became a member of Mufon several months ago and I&apos;m aware of several of the reports out there about &quot;Green Fireballs&quot;. I also listen to Art Bell and have heard Peter Davenport on the radio concerning these incidents. I decided to finally send you this report after hearing other people report similar  observations.
19980427	19980426	 Deventer, Overijssel (Netherlands),	 triangle	30-45 seconds	perfect triangle, approx 10-15 metres big moving at approx 70 mphI was opening my front door when I just got back from a friends then i looked back and saw something in the sky. I then observed it better and saw that it was a triangular shaped craft with 3 red light (one on each tip of the triangle). It moved quite slowly, approx. at 70 miles an hour (the speed of those small prvate planes) at the height of approx. 30-40 metres above some of the houses. The sky was pretty clear, a few clouds high up in the sky (it was night time). This hasn&apos;t been my first sighting, I think in the last 3-4 years I have had about 20 sightings varying from triangle ones to saucer shaped ones, tho this is the first one I&apos;m reporting.
19961030	19980408	 Rose Hill / Wichita, KS	 light	20 Minutes	I saw 3 bright, parallel red lightst 30 degrees above the horizon, lighting up one at a time from right to left. They covered a large portion of the sky.This is the second entry I have made to your sight.  I have been unable to find my previous entry listed and, being concerned that it somehow got lost, am transmitting a second.  This event occured October 30th, 1996.  I sighted the phenomenon alone ( I don&apos;t count my 2 year old son as a witness) but talked with 3 other people in the area who saw similar occurences.  The event was also broadcast on the local TV news and Wichita Eagle newspaper so you should be able to corroborate it.  According to the news, the majority of the sightings occured in Winfield Kansas which is about 20 miles south. At approximately 6:20 P.M. I was driving east on 47th street south, out of Wichita Kansas, about 3 miles west of Rose Hill road with my son.  I noticed three parallel bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They covered a sizable portion of the night sky and if they were attached to the same craft, it would have been huge.  They lit up, one at a time, from right to left five to six times which took about 30 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling, red lights just to the right of the furthest southern (right) light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued to monitor that section of the sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 4 1/2 miles east of Rose Hill on 180th street.  I got out of my car and started to go to the other side to get my son out.  As I did so I noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a line of multi-colored lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About two seconds later I observed more birght white, clustered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then dim down.  After another 5-10 seconds the wihite lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done previously.  I waited 15-20 seconds and then ran in the house to find another witness.  By the time we came back outside, the lights were gone and did not return.  I did however, see several airplane lights circling the area for atleast 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes I went back inside the house.  I called the Rose Hill police who said they had no other reports.  Shortly afterwards I heard about Winfield residents reporting strange lights on the nightly news. I called the Winfield police to report my sighting.  The dispatcher said that she had indeed received several similar reports that evening but did not take my report and did not seem concerned.  I attempted to call McConnell Air Force base, which is only 3-4 miles from my original sighting, but was unable to contact anyone. At the time of the sighting I was 35 years old.  I am divorced with a 3 year old son.  I have a college degree and am employed as a financial analyst with a large aircraft manufacturing company.
19930701	19980329	 Oklahoma City, OK	 triangle	4-5 minutes	2 triangle craft over OKC. 1 travled N to S. 2 traveled W to E. The craft were very high, could only see their shape with binoculars. Each had six lights down the side of the craft.I was out sky watching with binocular when I saw two lights very high and relativly close together in the sky.  It was a clear night and the visability was excellent.  I got my binoculars on the object traveling north to south first and as I was facing east the object was traveling from left to right in my field of view.  I quickly noticed approximatly 12 white or yellow lights, 6 running down each side of the craft in a V or triangular shape.  I almost could not believe what I was seeing.  There was this V shaped craft that had to be huge considering how high it was.  Without the binoculars I could have easily just passed the lights off as airline traffic.  But the craft were were large enough to easily make out the triangle shape with binoculars. Especially when I began to look at the other craft, which actually still closer to me than the one heading south. The second craft was heading east and was moving directly away from me, giving me a perfect view of the V shape.  And I would have to say that a V is a better discription of the craft than triangular because the craft seemed longer rather than wider.  Each craft proceeded in a slow steady manner and I remembered thinking how can these two ships be flying over OKC and there seemed to be no other planes up and interested in them.  I also thought that two identical craft passing each other the way they were was odd, almost like they were mapping something. I watched the two craft for 4-5 minutes before both were completly gone from view.  I wanted to call someone about the incident but never did.  I did report the sighting some months later to the local MUFON chapter but they never made a report either.
19980425	19980425	 Blanchard, OK	 triangle	23:00	I SAW  SOMTHING THAT WAS FLASHING RED BLUE AND GREEN LIGHTS. I GOT MY BINOCULERS AND GOT A BETTER LOOK,IT WAS AMAZING,I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE SOMTHING LIKE THIS. I GOT SEVERAL NEIGHBORS AND WE WATCHED FOR A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR THEN THE THREE OBJECTS JUST LEFT.THE OBJECTS WERE IN A TRIANGULER FORMATION. RED,GREEN,BLUE AND WHITE LIGHTS SPINNING CLOCKWISE MOVING CLOSER AND THEN AWAY BUT ALL THREE STAYING IN THE SAME FORMATION.

19980716	19980924	 Carson City, NV	 sphere	5 sec.	I was sitting outside, looking toward the mountains, Carson in almost 5k ft, Mts. 7k to 8k, object appeared and shot off in a straight line and than disappeared.As I said above I was sitting outside it was late 23:00 to 24:00. I was looking up toward the mountains and light blue/white sphere just appeared, it looked like it was going in a NE to SW direction parallel to the mountain. Almost thought it was shooting Star, but it slowed down and than shot off and disappeared. I know it was not a plane because a big jet was flying over the mountain at the same time. The only reason I am reporting now because it was being talked about on Art Bell last night 09/23/98. Just thought you would like to know, thank you.
19971214	19980323	 Auburn, IN	 sphere	2 minutes	We saw 3 unexplained, white orbs of light hovering over a church we were driving to.  We saw them from our car, and they hovered over the building in a tight triangular formation.  We tried to explain it away as an airplane, but airplanes don&apos;t hover in midair.  Thus, this 3-lighted-orb triangular formation still defies explanation.  The sighting lasted about 2 minutes.  We saw the same lights a couple of hours later (when we were leaving the church after a concert); these things were still hovering over it!The object consisted of a tight triangular formation of 3 white orbs of light. The lights hovered in their formation over a church building as we were approaching it in our car. There were three of us in the car heading to that church for a Christmas concert (12/14/97). Two of the observers (sister and mother) are skeptics who do not believe in the existence of UFOs. I (the third) had seen a UFO many years earlier (July 1984 at camp); I have been open to the possibility of their existence, and can not explain these objects in any earthly sense.
19980502	19980504	 Fort Smith, AR	 disk	quick	It flew above us, shined its lights upon us.  I don&apos;t remember what happened next.  I woke up about 15 minutes later, I think.  We were abducted by them.  They left a scar on my chest.I saw no aliens.  I remember being shined by a light, and then waking up later. i think they did tests on us.

19840415	19980208	 Lake Worth, FL	 disk	2 hours	Saw obj out window appx 0100. Enter E-W slow bright. Outside stared obj &lt;5m. Time on clock, &gt;1h. Hypn 5 yr later. Abduct, exam, unsettling.I was sole percipient, had insomnia one night, sat inside bedroom gazing at night sky approximately 0100 on 041584.  Saw a blazing white light enter field of vision from east, moving to west.  A dead pine tree served as a reference point.  Object halted behind the tree.  The motion of falling leaf was observed briefly.  Object stayed in sky throughout sighting.  Feeling some compulsion to go outside, I watched it from the back yard for what I thought was only a few minutes.  The weather was cool and I was not fully clothed, so felt cold.  I noticed the object seeming to drift slightly westward, still looking like bright blazing star.  Suddenly it moved about 90 degrees to the west, without transiting.  Tired, cold, I went in, sleepy finally, and went to bed.  Told someone the next day at work about it, got laughed at and forgot it for three years.  The book Communion was published, the cover startling me and triggering a memory of that night.  For two more years I thought about it often, reading Communion and some other things on UFOs.  In 1989 I had a hypnotic regression to the night in question, remembering in detail being taken up through the air to the object, taken aboard, examined, having communication with the occupants, including some joking and prophecy.  The object appeared to have a considerable amount of detail on both the outside and inside.  The occupants were short, gray-brown in color, and wearing red suits with black trim and some sort of smooth, tight-fitting head gear that seemed to cover a part ot their faces. They stood away from the table I was placed on, behind a half-wall.  A scanning device examined me.  I got a very good look at it such that I can see it as I write this.  There were several instances of the occupants joking with me to relax me and quell my fear.  There was an instance of forced physical paralysis with total loss of muscle control.  I kept my eyes closed during much of the experience.  At the end, two of them floated me back to the yard between them.  I was unable to look closely at them out of fear, and had a screen memory of their appearance.  The content was bizarre, odd, and frightening.  I left the hypnotherapy session very upset.  For several years subsequently I had a hard time with the memory.  The session was taped.  I transcribed the tape and studied it carefully.  There was an internal coherency but the content was very unusual.  Later, I read that the things that the occupants discussed (telepathically) were not so unusual in abductions.  I saw another clinician, a published author and psychiatrist who studies paranormal events.  Two more abductions were uncovered, going back to childhood.  Another emerged spontaneously.  One of them explained a mysterious short term leg paralysis that I had as a child.  Many pieces fell into place about bad memories from childhood, fear of windows at night, always looking into the night sky, and three previous sightings I had had.  Of those, one was multiple witnessed by parents and their friends.  No subsequent UFO activit! y occurred to me.  My sense of the occupants was that they were insincere, though trying to appear to be genuine and helpful.  I did not like what happened, feeling violated.  I was 36 years old at the time of the last event.  The others occured at 12, 8 and 4 years of age.  I am a trained, State licensed psychotherapist and a trained, State certified hypnotherapist, practicing now for thirty years.  I do not, nor have I ever, talked about the UFO encounters or my interest in them, nor is there any visual cue in my office that would tip off a patient that I would be amenable to a discussion of same.  Since the event and the hypnotic regression, a patient came to me who subsequently requested hypnotherapy and was surprised to reveal a tremendous amount of encounters going back to her age of four years.  Multiple family members were also involved, three of whom (two sisters and mother)I was able to interview and study hypnotically.  The mother had a conscious waking memory of her experience, which happened also when the daughter was four.  A sister only could remember the screen memory of a wolf&apos;s face at the window.  Another sister remembered from childhood a screen memory of white horses with large, black, glassy eyes staring at her inside her bedroom, then chasing her across the house.  These sessions went on with this patient for over one year, often meeting three times a week for two to three hour hypnotherapy sessions.  Finally, I had to steer it to a close, as I had become drained and emotionally upset by it.  The woman&apos;s children were also being abducted, all of whom I saw in the office and who talked about their experiences.  This experience, of treating this patient who was such an active percipient, was exhausting personally, although did serve to relieve the patient of significant disabling symptoms.  My sense of the occupants of her objects was that they were not benevolent.  Such was also the impression held by the patient.  I will be happy to send the transcript of my experience with any other material requested by mail.  No phone calls or email, please.
19980902	19980923	 Portland, OR	 disk	15 Seconds	I went out to lock my car at 11:33 PM on September 2nd and saw a white disk shaped object streak across the northern sky.The sighting was about 11:33 p.m. Sept 2, 1998.  White luminous disk traverses 70% of the northern horizon from east to west in 1 to 2 seconds parallel to horizon.  It was too high to be a plane over the Portland Airport yet quit low and too parallel to the horizon to be a shooting star.  Within 10 seconds another (more faint) object was seen traveling at a high rate of speed (yet much slower) in a northerly direction over (what I would call) the coastline of Oregon.  This was too fast to be a plane but much slower than the east-west object.  Yet both objects had a similar destination west of the coastline of the Northwest U.S. and disappeared.
19980620	19980923	 St.Helens, OR	 fireball	5 secs	brass/gold sparkling, no tail taveling east to west, rather slowly. tennis ball size at arms lenght in size, low in the horizon, no sound.
19920621	19980524	 Mt.Vernon, IL	 egg	45mn.	I was driving down route 15 ,when i noticed the craft resting on the ground It was about 200 yards away.I saw what looked like a huge dome in the middle of a corn field. It had vien-like structures on the sides of it and spotlights all the way around the base. The dome part was flashing like an electrical ark,it appeared to me to be in distress. There was alot of activity around the base ,like spot lights moving around frantically.The car in front of me slowed down to observe so i passed and got away . Isaw enough of the object to know i didnt want to get any closer to it.
19980227	19980309	 Hesperia, CA	 fireball	10 sec.	A bright blue object that streaked across the southern sky from east to west.I was indoors and happened to catch it pass to the south of my location through a large picture wiindow. It was traveling from east to west at a high speed. The color of the object was blue and it had a tail behind it. My guess is that it was a large meteor that I witnessed. No sound since I was indoors at the time. And I couldn&apos;t see if it looked like it impacted on the ground either. Kind of unusual to see a large meteor like that this time of the year. Haven&apos;t heard of any scheduled showers to be seen. Could be like what was reported over Colorado recently. If you are interested in hearing about a sighting that occurred on 08/17/69 over the San Fernando Valley of California then pleaase let me know and I will post it here. That sighting of seven large orange colored objects in formation was definitely much closer and had some very strange aspects to it. I witnessed it along with about six other persons. At the time, we did report it to the Air Force and all they said was, &quot;We don&apos;t know what they are.&quot;
19780714	19980308	 Spokane, WA	 disk	15-20 mins	A friend and I were driving and saw something odd in the sky coming towards us. We pulled over along with some other people to watch.A friend and I had left work in the valley to run up to the northside to pick something up and bring it back to our work. It was getting close to closing time so it was probably around 10:30pm when we were headed south on the old Argonne highway. I was driving and I happened to look out my window. I spotted what looked like headlights  shining thru the trees on top of a mountain. I said to my friend, &quot;look at that car on the mountain&quot;. I then realized that it couldn&apos;t be a car because if a car was up there we wouldn&apos;t have been able to see it&apos;s headlights.Then we quickly noticed that it was moving in the sky heading our way. We saw a couple of cars pulled off the road ahead and people were standing outside watching so we pulled over too. We were shivering by then, excited and scared at the same time cause we couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. The only thing I really remember is the lights. It had a center light big and round and two smaller lights one on each side of the middle light. They were bright white lights. It came right towards us moving very very slow and I heard a very very faint hum. It seemed so close, like if I craweled to the top of a tree I could have reached out and touched the bottom. I don&apos;t really remember seeing the actual craft, but in my mind I know it was like a round disk not flat but maybe with a slighly rounded belly to it, but the lights were so bright you couldn&apos;t see it anyway. It passed over us and continued on and we all stood there dumbfounded our hearts racing until we couldn&apos;t see it over the treetops anymore. All of us that were standing there just looked at each other and said wow, what was that. My friend and I got into the car and headed back to work, we had the creeps the rest of the night. I had no knowledge of any aircraft that could fly so low, quiet and slow. Before this incident I saw the same type craft when I slept over at a different friends house one summer. It must have been the summer of 77, I was fifteen at the time. We were in our sleeping bags in the backyard. It was late maybe 11:00 pm. We were laying there talking and staring at the stars. There were alot of trees in her neighborhood and in her yard. Anyway we were just laying there looking up at the beautiful stars and then we saw this craft pass over us so slow, virtually no sound and the same lights as I described before. We were so scared, we waited for it to pass over before we lept up and raced into the house screaming and freaking out. We jumped into her bed and pulled the covers over our heads. This one was also flying very low, seemed like treetop level. Too close for comfort! Of course we told everyone but no one believed us. I am now 36 years old and have not seen anything like this since, although I would like to. My grandmother lives in Newman Lake , Wa and she has watched crafts play what she calls war games over her house. I wish I could have been there to see that! Don&apos;t know how often it has happened but I know she&apos;s observed them several times. I think she said these were colorful lights and they would zoom through the sky doing quick turns and racing back in the opposite direction. This wasn&apos;t just a brief display, these war games lasted maybe 45 minutes or so.
19980402	19980403	 Greenville, OH	 other	4 seconds	Was walking dog, noticed in eastern sky 2 crescent shaped objects. flying side by side , with the right one slightly ahead.I was walking my dog at 10:50 p.m. The sky was clear and I was watching out for shooting stars when I notice coming from the east ( if I were to point at them,  my arm would be at a 45 degree angle...NOTE; the angles are given as if straight up is 0 degrees) two objects. These objects were crescent shaped with the horns toward the back. Both had a soft whitish glow to them, and both wavered or wrippled like reflections off of a pond .They crossed over me so that my head was at a 10 - 15 degree angle. The objects where silent and left no trails behind them, the top object was slightly ahead of the other. They would drift toward each other with the two inner crescent horns over lapping .They did this 3 to 4 times. The objects disappeared heading west. They faded from view at the same 45 degree angle as when they came into view. There was a jet ( I believe passenger) flying close by. To me the jet and objects appeared no more than 1 to 2 inches apart. The objects gave me the impression of being lower than the jet..though they did not pass between me and the jet. It was at this time that they faded from view. I am a 27 year old honor roll graduate of Greenville High School.  My hobbies include art, astronomy, biology, geology and many of the other sciences as well.
19980307	19980309	 Vero Beach (Northern), FL	 formation	2.5 minutes	2 bright lights moving toward us one lower the other. One turns and disappears leaving an illuminated doughnut shaped fog.  Then the other light did the exact same thing.Two bright white lights were obeserved by my wife, niece, and myself.  It was March 7, 1998 at 6:45 P.M. The lights were moving in a westerly direction at the same speed, but different heights. The light on the right was slightly lower than the one on the left. No sounds were coming from the lights.  They looked as if they were shining a light in a downward glow.  Suddenly the lower light on the right pivoted  approx 180 degrees and disappeared, leaving an illuminated doughnut shaped glow, that lasted approximately 10-15 seconds and then dissapated. The other light never stopped moving. It continued going in  the same direction at the same speed. for at least 15 seconds after  the doughnut glow disappeared.  Then just like the other light, it turned away from us and disappeared, leaving the same doughnut glow, which as the first, lasted around 15 seconds and dissapated as well. No object observed just 2 distinct lights.  After the lights turned away from us they simply disappeared, they didn&apos;t seem to fly away, or go in any direction, they just disappeared, leaving the dought shaped signature, and our thoughts running wild.  Like nothing we have ever seen before. This was also witnessed by our neighbors who were having a party. 10 of their guests also witnessed the lights.((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))
19781025	19980506	 Virginia City, MT	 other	10 minutes	While elk hunting South of town I sighted a huge object which was shiny like mylar or a mirror but seemed metalic. It was shaped like a (vitamin capsule) not really cigar shape more full. The object rose over a hill where I was looking for elk and sat just above the horizon for about 10 mins then kind of faded away. The object was huge maybe 300 feet long and 100 feet high. I was looking from the north but the object was a shiny as if it was in full sun. It rose very slowly almost as if a cloud. I&apos;m curious if objects like this have been seen before all I seem to hear about are discs and lights. This was real!As I said above I was elk hunting in the late fall of 1978 about 4 miles south of Virginia City, Montana. It must have been about 1600 or 1630. I was sitting on a south facing slope looking across a small valley perhaps 500 yards across. I was scanning the sparce timber just below the horizon when a huge (vitamin capsule shaped) object perhaps 300 feet long and 100 feet high, it may have been larger but those proportions are pretty close, and I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t smaller. The object was more shiny than metal it looked like mylar, or a mirror, in reflectance but seemed hard surfaced. The side I was looking at was facing north with the sun behind and to the right of it, but not visible, yet the object was as shiny as if it were in full sunlight. It was the brightest thing in the sky, much more intense than the sky. It seemed to rise very slowly and as it was doing so didn&apos;t alarm me, it was as if I were a child watching a cloud rise over a hill. As it rose up from behind the hill slowly it rose to a point maybe 100 feet above the horizon then gradually decended until part of it was below the horizon meaning it was on the north side of the ridge I was looking at giving me a sense of the scale against the hillside. I had no emotional reaction just ho hum which when looking back seems really strange. Anyway I sat there and watched the object for what must have been 10 minutes and honestly I don&apos;t remember how it disappeared. I just remember thinking that I had better leave to get back to the car before dark because I still had a ways to drive on an unimproved road before getting home.  That is another strange thing I then remember being about 200 yards from the sighting place causually walking down the trail totally unconcerned, not looking over my shoulder to see if it re-appeared or anything. When I got home I don&apos;t even think I told my wife which really puzzles me in retrospect. Normally we talked about everything. I am very curious as to whether any other people have seen an object such as this as it seems ! like all I hear about is saucer shaped objects or lights.
19980307	19980308	 Fort Myers, FL	 fireball	1 minute	2 incoming spheres of light with cone shaped mist eminating from all around the spheres.Standing facing east,the spheres were moving from east to west. They were at the same altitude and were moving at a high rate of speed together. The spheres of bright light were traveling parallel to the ground at approx. 30 degrees above the horizen. At 55 seconds one of the spheres seemed to disintegrate into a puff of mist. 5 seconds later the second one disintegrated as well in the same manner. The 3 observers were father,69; son,45; grandson,14.Many other people in Ft. Myers observed this as well and reported the sightings to the Southwest Florida Regional Airport.((NUFORC:  Report caused by missile launch at sea by U. S. submarine.))
19960415	19980208	 Long Beach, CA	 fireball	1.5 seconds	A Large Brilliant green fireball was seen &quot;fall to earth&quot; in the direction of the Long beach airport.There was no fire or evidence of a crash, so I assume the &quot;craft/fireball&quot; went into one of the many hangars present directly in the line of path of descent.It was at approximately 05:11 in the morning that i was on the way to work, I had been driving north for about 45 minutes on the 405 FWY. The morning was dark and it was foggy, the general area was illuminated by the city lights and was not very bright. As i was passing the Sign indicating that the Lakewood blvd off ramp was coming up, I observed  a brilliant green/white fireball with tail about the size of a silver dollar in my windshield. the angle of descent was approximately 40 degrees from left to right from the corner of my windsheild to approximately 6 inches above the base of my windsheild to about 3/4 of the windsheild along the base. It then totally disappeared. I estimate the distance approximately at 1-1.5 miles in front of me from where i was on the freeway The fog gave the fireball a fuzzy appearance around its perimeter. I tried to see if other drivers on the freeway had seen it, but at 70mph and in the darkness it was impossible to make eye contact with other drivers. &gt;From the angle of descent and approximate distance, i judged that the Fireball must have gone in the direction of the many hangars that occupy that airport and also face the freeway. Note: the speed of descent was rapid as if it were falling at great speed. I was expecting a fire or crash in the area of  the projected collision, but as i passed by , there were NO fires or explosions.  I found out that there was no one in the tower at that time, so i could not verify my sighting with anyone. I checked radio news and newspapers at the time ,but no mention of a crash. MY guess is that it was no meteorite( it was too big and there would have been fire), is that it may have been one of  our craft which may have been in trouble and had to &quot;land&quot; in the city under extraordinary conditions. I have since heard of fireballs in seattle and i figured i  would finally report it to someone, I figured the police would not accept a report.
19980307	19980308	 Sarasota, FL	 cone	30 seconds	Object observed coming from SE at twilight, sky very clear and not yet dark. Object was white with small white core moving towards us (direction NW) and a cone shaped haze behind it.  It moved steadily towards NW then suddenly seemed to disolve.There were about 10 people around me at the time - in Island Park in Sarasota on the bayfront, a popular place for taking walks.  The sky was perfectly clear and calm, the sun had set in the west and it was dusk but not dark in the east.  We all saw the object coming towards us -- others saw 2 objects, I just saw the one.  I realized it was not a plane.  The only other possiblity was a launch from Cape Canaveral which we can see from our coast when it is clear.  Except, CC is further north and object launched from it leave a clear vertical vapor trail.  This object was very white with a cone-shaped white haze behind it - could have been moving quickly, it was hard to say.  I observed it for about 20-30 seconds then it suddenly seemed to disolve and disappear.  The front (core) part of the object was very solid, very real, it was not a trick of light or anything else we could figure out.  Afterwards I discussed it with a few others who had seen it -- no one had any idea what it could be.((NUFORC:  Consistent with missile launch.))
19980220	19980221	 Fairfield, CA	 disk	10mins	While at lunch and sitting in my car I noticed an object moving across the Southern Sky. It was Saucer shaped and provided a beam aspect from my position . As it flew in a steady straight course fro East to west and glimmered in the sunlight. There was no Tail or ampenage or wings and as it flew and then disappeared behind the ajasoed Buildings. afew moments latter it reappeared now  goingfor waest to east and never made a sound as it flew. Then before going out of sight obsured by the hills to the east in darted upward and into some cloudsand was gone.A Saucer shaped craft having a beam or side on view toward me. It was dull Metallic Grey and light reflected from the surface of the craft. It moved about 150-200 Mph at an altitude of between 1000 and 2000 ft. iT was perhaps 1-1.5 miles away for me .
19980426	19980427	 Comer, GA	 disk	30min	on 4/25-26/98, a strange object was seen in the southern sky b/w 23:50 &amp; 0:20.  it hovered high in sky, moved quickly to southeast, hovered, then moved back to the south, hovered for 20min, then disappeared.Between 23:50 &amp; 0:20 on 04/25-26/98, my brother and I observed a peculiar object moving around in the southern sky, approx. 40 degrees above the horizon.  The object was seen with the naked eye and 7x35 binoculars.  It was a dull red, more of a glow than an actual color.  it had an apparent length of maybe .25-.5 inches.  The shape was like that of a disk seen almost edge on.  The object was symetrical, appearing fuzzy at the edges, and the center was more focused and somewhat brighter.  These details were seen only through the binoculars, not the naked eye.  It maintained the same color and shape and orientation in the sky (meaning the object&apos;s flat shape stayed flat relative to the earth&apos;s surface, horizontal, never vertical or whatever).  It moved towards the north slightly, maybe only a few degrees.  As seen through the binoculars, the object hovered at times and jiggled or moved only slightly.  Then around midnight the object abruptly moved to the southeast, almost 45 degrees, where it stayed for about a minute, then quickly moved back to where it was before in the south.  I had a difficult time following the object due to it moving so fast.  It stayed around 35-45 degrees above the horizon.  The stars in the background (in the binoculars) were very out of focus, meaning the object was close to us, how close, it&apos;s difficult to say, a few hundred feet or thousands of feet, I don&apos;t know.  The object moved out of focus twice, causing me to adjust the focus of the binoculars.  It appeared to move closer, slightly growing in size, then back, all within a minutes time.  Then around 0:20, it dissapeared. I was a physics major in college, and I do a little amateur astronomy as a hobby, so I know the difference b/w a star or an airplane or a meteor or whatever and what it was that I saw.  I really have no clue as to what it was, but by it&apos;s motion and shape, it was NOT man made or some natural phenomenon.  The weather conditions were good, a little haze around the horizon, but clear otherwise.  So we had no trouble seeing the thing.  I am nearsighted, that&apos;s why I could not see it without the binoculars, but my brother has better vision than I, and he could see it quite well w/o aid.  My brother is 15 and I am 21.  We live in a rural area, so there are no extranious lights or other sundry things around that could ever be mistaken for a ufo.  Airplanes do come over our area quite frequently, but at high altitudes.   Because we see planes as often as we do, we definately know the difference b/w one and what we saw.  Plus, the object didn&apos;t blink like the lights on a plane do.  Or move in a specific pattern, either.  Simply moved around and glowed the same shade of dull red the whole time, staying in the same general area, except when it moved over to the southeast.
19980523	19980613	 Boston Location/Hancock, MI	 disk	2 minutes	Object was hovering briefly, turned about a 45 degree angle, stayed there a moment then disappeared.It was a bright, clear late afternoon and my wife and myself were driving thru St. Mary&apos;s location.  The skies were clear for the most part, not many clouds at all.  As I was driving, something caught my eye in the sky in the north west.  It was silver, shining, disc shaped, but looked flat on the top and bottom.  It was just huvering there then all of a sudden it turned to about a 45 degree angle, slowly started moving north, then in less than a second it just vanished.

19980821	19980923	 Mt Sterling, IL	 light	30 minutes	8/21-8/27  Approx. 50 lights in south sky moving up &amp; down, &amp; side to side.On 8/21/98 approx. 50 lights were seen in our southern sky all at once. These lights seemed to cover the sky moving in up and down motions, like baloons on a string. The lights were witnessed by many people including an Illinois state police trooper. These lights were seen &amp; reported From Macomb, Il. to Hannibal, Mo. The Air National Guard unit reported that there was no millitary activity in the area. On 8/22/98 a black unmarked helicoptor landed at our fairgrounds and remained for most of the day. These sightings lasted for 6 consecutive nights, with good footage shot by KHQA TV channel 7 in Quincy, Il. After the news report the Air National Guard reported that what had been witnessed was after burners of their fighter aircraft. On 9/12/98 at approx. 21:15 hrs. I witnessed 1 large ball of light in the northern sky at approx. 30 degrees above the horizon. This ball of light split into 2 balls. The 2nd ball traveled to the west and stopped staying paralel with the first. The second ball started moving up and down rapidly and then traveled back to join the first. As the two joined back together they seemed to implode into nothing. This activity lasted approx. 5 minutes from start to finish. I shut off my car and got out to witness this event, and there was not a sound.
0000	19980617	 Los Angeles (Hollywood Hills, north of), CA	 circle	15 seconds	Newspaper said argentinian scient&apos;sts has connected w. radio message that said saucer would come 9:30 San Luis Obispo in SF area, l0pm LA. My mother, her friends and me and Barbie, two l0 yr olds, went in convertible. TOP OF HILLS. l0PM cop comes, says private driveway, these people complained. We started down Laurel canyon back to Sunset, SAUCER was big as moon, bright like sun, slowly moved from one side ofsky next to canyon at east across sky, slowly, silently to west mountains. Laurel Canyon is a canyon between mountains. Tops of mountains were maybe half mile from us, so saucer was half mile away but it seemed big like moon. Crossed sky slowly, went behind the other mountain top. Next day barbie and I called firemen, police. No one had seen it. She&apos;s still alive, we&apos;re both mid fifties. My Mom is nearly 90, she recalls it. NEXT time I SAW them was l973, in LA, FIVE perfect circles like dimes way up high, moving from say ll oclock west to 2 o clock east sky, but slowly. They were so high up that at 2 oclock they became hard to see, So small.  My four kids were with me. Eldest recalls it still.My background? Mother was literary, got her Masters at USC, in school of Journalism, grad l934. My father was educated in Leipzig then Paris and Oxford for music. His father was conductor of Leipzig opera.

19580715	19980226	 Novato, CA	 disk	1min30sec	saw saucer in large grass field it took off straight over vehicle went into sky and dissappearedMy father and I were returning from a hunting trip in Ukiha CA.  It was on a Sunday 5:30 p.m. on 101 hwy south.  We saw this shiny greyish object about 30 to 40 feet in diameter next to the edge of SanFrancisco Bay.  The reason why we noticed it was the field had caught a fire.  Then the object took off almost in a 45 degree angle straight toward us which was west and it was moving at such a great speed that after a few moments it just got smaller and smaller until it dissapeared.  The saucer was totaly quiet.  It had no lights that we could see and it left the grass field totaly burning.  My Father was an opperating engineer all his life.  He always wanted me not to talk about it because people would think that we were crazy or something.  And for myself I am 56 years old and don&apos;t care what they say.  My Dad is passed away so there is no one else that could back me up except if anybody like fire departments, the farmers, or anyone else that had seen the fire, or the saucer itselt.  I would like to know if there was a report around that area and time, that would make me feel a little better.  I am very mechanicaly inclined and know that this was not something that the US had developed for a few years later I saw the nasa research flying saucer in the old hanger at Mofet field in Mountain View CA and it was nothing in comparison to what my father and I saw.

Lights in sky (mars brightness) seen several nights in a row by USAF members at Wheelus AFB.After finishing a graveyard shift, a number of other airmen and myself would often hang out at the basketball court at the 6930th RGM at Wheelus AFB in Tripoli, Libya. One such morning I looked to the north and saw a light sweeping across the sky with a very slight undulating path. I pointed it out and we all speculated what it might be. (this was a bunch of pretty smart guys due to our mission) We discounted inversion reflections, F-86D with afterburners (no satellites yet!) meteors. While speculating, here comes another one! Well for three nights in a row, we saw 4 to ten in one night. Although they were comeing from different parts of the norther horizon, they seemed to vanish pretty nearly the same place on the southern. (as determined by a fiducial point, an antenna)The path, when check on a map, was straight across the libyan desert crossing the Tbilsi Mountains.I did talk to an airman at the A C &amp; W squadron (radar) after hearing the F-86D&apos;s scramble obviously in response to these odd lights. He said, &quot;Oh, Yeah. We see these all the time&quot; and quoted a speed I can&apos;t remember but was very fast.(it was odd to scramble jets at that time of the morning unless it was for an earnest cause- the officers do like their sleep!)
19980104	19980106	 Nashville, TN	 circle	5 minutes	Summary : I was going south on hwy 41 just before Briley pkwy exit. saw circular craft with row of lights on leading edge slowly drift across hwy. craft was approx. 3- 500 ft up.was moving from right to left (west to east) across hwy. was to slow to be plane; to large to be helicopter. After crossing hwy craft hoverd, descended,and dissapeard behind trees.road constuction in near area.intend to investigate asap.will report.i am a believer in search of hard evidence to prove that there is more to these sightings than we relize or could ever imagine.the above account is brief and i will update soon with drawings and more information providing my investigations are successful. i am pressed for time and must leave. i will be in contact.
19980307	19980311	 Orlando, FL	 light	2 Minutes	We saw 2white lights in the sky about 300 yards apart and 30 feet in diameter. One was close to a cloud, and dissapeared behind the coud. The other just went out. We thought they were rocket boosters from the Cape, but there was no con or smoke trail.We were part of a group of German Folkmusik enthusiasts, in a tour bus, from Stylus Transportation, traveling from the Riand Continental Hotel to the Disney&apos;s Wide World of Sports Field house, to see an Austrian music show called The Musikantenstadl. I am sure of the time because we were about five minutes from the event, and we exited the bus at the event at 18:50. I looked out the window of the bus and saw the 2 fairly bright white lights, that looked to be about 30 feet in diameter in the sky to the left of the bus. I told my wife to look, and she asked what are those lights. The other people sitting on the left side of the bus also saw them. I thought as did other people on the bus, that they were rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral, although I made the comment that these are the first rockets I ever saw that have no propellant or con trail. It looked exactly like looking directly into the tail end of a rocket booster. We didn&apos;t give it any more thought until we returned to Los Angeles and saw a news report of the event on the Monday evening news and found out that there were no missiles fired from the cape. We saw both objects for about 2 minutes. The seemed to be about 300 yards apart, and one was next to a cloud, the other in the open sky.The light away from the cloud just went out about 5 seconds before the other light moved behind the cloud and disappeared. There was very little lateral movement, if any, on either object.((NUFORC:  Consistent with missile launch.))
19761031	19980924	 Garland, TX	 other	2 minutes	Halloween-walking inside with parents, saw several missile shaped, copper crafts flying in a line formation at a low altitude, very slow, over my house.I was 4 or 5, and it was Halloween.  I had been across the street from my house playing with a friend, and my mother came to take me home for bed.  I always went to bed around 8:00. As we were walking across the street, I saw almost directly over me, and flying over my house (about 10 ft above house), a line of crafts that were copper, and shaped like missiles.  They were going pretty slowly, and there were no windows or anything like that.  It made no noise. I had the distinct feeling that there was somebody(s) up there watching us--the street was full of children in costumes. I asked my mother what they were, and pointed to them, but she could not see anything.  I pointed again, and still she couldn&apos;t see anything, and we went in my house.  I wasn&apos;t thinking at that time about &quot;aliens&quot;--I just knew it was something I had never seen before, was very unusual, and that nobody else seemed to notice.  It wasn&apos;t until years later I would connect it with the possibility of it being extraterrestrial.
19980922	19980924	 Big Lake, AK	 light	3 minutes?	Observer awoke and looked out window, seeing greenish colored light being orbited by smaller white/yellow lightsObserver awoke from sound sleep and looked out window, seeing greenish colored light being orbited by smaller white/yellow lights Approx. distance from observer 1/2 mile+, altitude 500-1000 feet, larger light estimated to be 20-50 feet dia., observed hovering in erratic manner before moving away at rapid speed to the S.E.
19980307	19980312	 Tampa, FL	 unknown	30 seconds	I viewed two bright white-colored objects for about 20-30 seconds just before dusk. The objects then vanished.When driving up I-275 north to work Saturday evening, I saw two unusual bright white-glowing lights moving slowly in the north in the distant sky. It was was still daylight. I can verify Dr. Acker&apos;s report of &ldquo;tails&rdquo; appearing to stretch behind the objects. After observing these two lights for about 20-30 seconds, the trailing light vanished. A few seconds later, the first light vanished. They did not reappear. &gt;From my viewpoint, the objects did not move in any unusual angles as others have reported.((NUFORC:  Consistent with missile launch.))
19980422	19980617	 Pacific, WA	 light	3-4 sec	Saw one blue-green lite pass south-west under Sea-Tac fligh trafic.Observed one blue-green light passing approx South-West. Observed through bedroom window while watching TV. Light caught my eye because of color and speed which was aprox 3 times faster than Sea-Tac air traffic which can be seen at same time. Ligh appeard to be lower than Income Sea-Tac traffic landing from the south. Light was steady and did not flicker, maybe half size of quarter at arms length. View object under 5 seconds before object passed above ridge line of Kent Valley. I checked clock for time which read 21:24
19980521	19980528	 Spokane, WA	 light	4seconds	looking north over the spires of Gonzaga University sighted a small, pea sized, light travelling west to east approx 45 degrees above the horizonAt 2:30 AM,on 5&#x5C;21&#x5C;98, while talking my usual lunchtime walk on the centenial trail between the USPS main annex and Gonzaga University I looked north off the bridge crossing the Spokane River and sighted a lighted objected travelling west to east at approx 45 degrees above the horizon.  Est the size to be about the size of a pea held at arms length and of a blueish white color.  No noise was heard which is what caught my attention. Also, most aircraft travel in an east west direction as the airport and airbase are southwest of the city.  Speed was more consistent with that of a jet coming in for landing - slow and steady - covering approx six inches of sky in, I guess, four seconds.  At this point the object simply disappeared - I thought it may have gone behind a cloud but it never reappeared.
19890810	19980314	 Martinsburg, WV	 triangle	45 seconds	Seen an object very high in the sky, moving at a high rate of speed to the south and jumping side to side while continuing to move forward lateral. Had three flashing bluish/white lights that flashed in a counter-clockwise triangle.I, who was 13 at the time, and a friend who was 14 were camping out under the stars in my back yard. It was a mostly clear night with a full moon and some scattered high cirrus clouds. My friend saw the object first and immediately pointed it out to me. It was three strobe-like lights flashing in a counter-clockwise triangle. It was moving very fast across the sky from north to south. It passed over the scattered cirrus clouds, so I estimate it must have been above 50,000 feet in altitude. It would move irratically from side to side and diagonal while maintaining it&apos;s forward (southerly) course. It was as if it was actually jumping like a water bug. Since it was at least 50,000 feet in altitude, I estimate when it jumped it was jumping at least a couple of miles at a time. We observed the object until it cleared our horizon (until we could no longer see it). It was moving too fast for me to even run and get my telescope out of the house. It cleared our horizon in about 45 seconds time. A passenger jet at altitude takes nearly five minutes to clear our horizon. Taking that into consideration, this thing must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. It didn&apos;t leave a contrail of any kind and it made no sound. I never actually seen the body of the object; all I could see was the lights, so I&apos;m assuming it was shaped like a triangle because of the pattern of the lights. The lights were not very bright -- they were like a strobe in the sense that they flashed similarly to a strobe but they were much softer then strobes. They were bright enough to see through the cirrus clouds when passing above them. I called the local Air National Guard and they refered me to a UFO reporting line, which I called and reported to. They seemed quite interested in my observation. I have never seen this object or anything similar since. It was a very exciting night for a couple of young teenagers. As for backgrounds, we were just normal kids. I am thankful that we were able to see such an awesome sight. I will never forge! t it.
19980923	19980924	 Tacoma (southwest of), WA	 fireball	5 sec.	At 10 min. after 9pm  I was facing to the south during my lunch break when I saw a fireball with a green tail traveling east to west at about a 20&apos; angle.  As it was traveling down it seemed to have a wavey motion  the object appeared out of nowhere lasting about 5 sec. then it disappeared. It moved slower then a shooting star would move.
19980324	19980325	 Fort Pierce/Orlando (between), FL	 fireball	45 minutes	We watched for 45 minutes 2 lights, then 1 light in the sky. It looked like a orange fireball and stayed with us as we drove north bound on the FL turnpike. It disappeared suddenly.My husband and brother in law were talking in the front seat of our van while I sat in the back trying to figure out what these 2 lights were that remained at the same size and distance to the NE of the van. We were traveling N on the Turnpike and we were N of Fort Pierce at approx 10 PM Tuesday March 24th. The lights were the color of flame, very bright and appearing to be high enough up to stay in a fixed position as we headed north. We lost them, maybe in trees, then they appeared again to the NW of our position. We lost them again, then one reappeared. It was very clear, no trees, no hills, no clouds, just stars and this bright flame colored light. We watched these lights for about 45 minutes which would have been quite a distance at the high rate of speed we were traveling. While all 3 of us were staring at the light trying to figure out what it was is just disappeared and there was nothing to see but a large number of stars in the bright sky. We all agreed that is was unlike any thing we had seen before. Observers are (2) college graduates (Accounting), 44 year old female and 33 year old male self employed in the computer industry and a 26 year old male employed at a grocery chain distribution center.
19980826	19980923	 Mariposa, CA	 fireball	5 Seconds	Observed a light behind a tree that was bright white, then it took off and as it did, it turned brillaint greenI was walkng outside when I noticed a REALLY bright &quot;star&quot; behind a tree in our front yard... when I looked at it for a moment, it shot off and turned a briallant Blue-Green, it shot off towards the mountain and disapeared right before it got there.  I believe that our Long/Latt is this 37W,120N  (I THINK!) We are about 15 miles directly south-west of Yosemite Nat&apos;l Park in California thanks.
19980606	19980609	 Reno, NV	 formation	2 minutes	My wife and I were on our way to Reno. I was looking at a large cloud formation that was pouring out an unbelievable amount of rain. While looking, a shiny object caught my eye. It was just at cloud level. It was V shape in formation, pointing west. It was made up of 7 silver balls. It passed in and out of the clouds, and finally dissappeared in them.My wife and I were on our way to Reno. I was looking at a large cloud formation that was pouring out an unbelievable amount of rain. While looking, a shiny object caught my eye. It was just at cloud level. It was V shape in formation, pointing west. It was made up of 7 silver balls. It passed in and out of the clouds, and finally dissappeared in them. At first I thought the formation could have been balloons because of its low elevation. However, the object never changed shape. The object was just at the bottom level of the clouds. It would pass through lower parts of the clouds, and then re-imerge. It was very windy that day. Extremely windy, however, the bject never deviated from its straight course. Sorry, I had no camera at the time, nor a camcorder. My wife and I live in Quincy, CA. About 75 miles from Reno. We were going for a few hours to shop. I work at the saw mill, and she works for Safeway. Also, my mother and father were watching KCRA news on Channel 3. The luive &quot;sky cam&quot; was overlooking Sacramento on 06/04/98 at 12:20pm. Both of the also saw balls of lights in the clouds. They saw 2 sets of 2 balls emerge from the clouds together. They also saw a formation that appeared as the Big Dipper appears in the sky. Although they do have a VCR, the &quot;sky cam&quot; shots over Sacramento are very brief, allowing them to only observe the event. Haime Maussan has video of balls of light coming out of heavy cloud cover over Mexico City, some of them observing the planes closely. What are these things doing in the clouds? Thanks.
19730405	19980530	 Houston, TX	 disk	30 seconds	Perfect disk with lights on edge; one side red, one side green: no sound No clouds, disk blocked out stars, moving S.to N.This happened in, or around, April of 1973.  I remember that it was close to my birthday.  The weather was mild and cloudless.  I think it was a Saturday night because my parents were out.  I was almost 12, a well read and responsible kid, with no more than a passing interest in the unknown. For some reason, I went out to my front yard (the house was in the 2500 block of Southgate Blvd, Houston,TX,77025)and looked straight up.  At that moment a large disk (red lights on one side, green lights on the other, not shiny, totally silent)passed directly overhead, blotting out the stars as it passed.  It moved in a straight line over my house towards the north and I watched it until it was out of sight:  total only about 30 seconds.  As it moved away it appeared to be completely flat, and not very thick: a true disk, like a discus or a coin.  Oddly, I wasn&apos;t alarmed.  I didn&apos;t tell my parents or anyone at school.  And I pretty much forgot about it until around 1981. I know this was not the Goodyear blimp; I had seen the blimp at night in our part of the city before.  The shape was wrong, and the blimp was far from silent at that altitude. The disk was well above tree height, in that neighborhood of tall pine trees.  My closest guess on the size and altitude would be 100&apos; across and 1000&apos; off the ground. I am hoping that others may have seen this.
19980327	19980328	 Clifton Park (30 min north of Albany), NY	 other	15min	it came after me and my dog, i was walking him that nightHi my name is Jason and i&apos;am 16 years old.  Tonight 11:30pm. {3/27/98} I was walking my dog in my development {New York, in clifton park, 30 min north of Albany} when i noticed a bright yellow light.  At first iI thought it was a airplane but then it moved from side to side and then it got as small as a star then it got bigger again.  it started to move away so i walked down to the end of the street to get a better look at it.  The light started to get bigger and bigger and i started to make out the shape of what it looked like.  As it got closer to me i started to run away.  It was shining 4 or 5 spot lights around were i was but just for about 3 sec. then it was following me and then it crossed {behinde me which was the road i was standing on} it looked like a top hat but all the coners were cut of like if u take a square and off a coner of it, and it had just to lines for the door going from the bottom of it to the top.  It also had little windows around the whole thing.  As i looked at it as i was running it was coming down on a angle.  it was about a 100 feet from the tree tops. It had lights all around the whole ship and one on the top of the ship. As it got closer it had a mist of the color cyan around it.  As I ran back to my house with my dog i noticed i couldn&apos;t see it anymore because the trees were in the way.  When i got back to my house I told my dad what happened.  We went looking outside my dad saw the bright yellow light in the distance and it was heading north then dissapeared.  I have attached a picture that i have drawn of what i saw.  I would like to know if u had any pictures that looked like this one and if there was any other ufo sightings in that areaaround that time.  Thank you for your time

In front of me traveling north to south were 5 bright balls moving verryy fast andeqally spaced with no comet trail. I was stunned and amazed. The first thing i did was to ask th couple at the pool if they also saw this. They did and the three of us had a conversation . I let them stay in the pool...... I have never fogotton that night. I have spoken with many other people who have seen this . The hawaians call it THE FIREBALLS
19980310	19980316	 Columbia, SC	 diamond	5 minutes	Brightly lighted craft hovering over us on Interstate 26.  Had lights shining down from the craft as well as lights shining up into the sky. It was quite low over our car and approximately the size of a large airplane.My two daughters (ages 17 and 10) and I were driving from West Virginia to Florida for vacation and at approximately 7:00p.m. March 10 we were east of Columbia, South Carolina, heading east toward I95.  In the distance, somewhat to the right of the highway we could see a very bright light in the sky.  At first we thought it was from a radio tower as its altitude seemed to be only about that high and it was stationary.  As we got closer we could see no tower, just this incredibly bright light hanging motionless. We kept driving toward it and the road somewhat curved to the right and the light was then right over the highway in front of us.  It looked at first like an airplane but when we were almost under it we could see the shape.  It had four distinct sides with the brightest lights on the points but with lights all along each side.  It was slightly elongated, like a diamond shape, with the ends pointing east/west.  There were lights similarly placed on the top of the craft which were shining straight up. We pulled off the road when we were directly under the craft so my daughter could get our binoculars and camera from the trunk.  When we stopped, the craft slowly started to move away, to the east, and before we could get the binoculars out, it picked up speed and moved away. We had a very good look at the craft when it was above us.  It was a clear night with no rain or fog and there was a nearly full moon.  The altitude of the craft was quite low...maybe 500 feet above us.  None of us had a clear look at the substance of the craft due to the intensity of the lights from it.  My younger daughter thought she could see the triangular &quot;wings&quot; but was not sure about that.
19750815	19980311	 McKenzie, TN	 cone	3-5 minutes	Observed two shiny objects which resembled a child&apos;s top flying west to east in the twilight.I was standing on my front porch looking toward the north when I saw two glints moving along about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. I immediately ran into the hours and got a pair of 10 x 50 binoculars. Through the binoculars I could see that the objects were very shiny and shaped like a top, with the pointed portion down. They were moving at a steady rate of speed, but not especially fast. There were no signs of any sort of contrail or vapor coming from them.  My daughter, who was seven years old at the time, was outside and I hurriedly called her to come. I helped her hold the glasses and moved them around until she located the objects and her immediate comment confirmed my initial observation: &quot;They&apos;re tops, dad!&quot; she exlaimed. I watched these objects for three or four minutes until they faded from view. I would also note that shortly after I observed these objects, our pet dog--and every dog within earshot--began to howl and bark. I heard no sound whatsoever associated with the passages of these objects, although they were quite a distance away. I had the impression that they were perhaps two or three miles away at a minimum, which would have made them quite large. I should also note that I am a newspaper reporter and something of a trained observer and trained to give fairly accurate descriptions of events.
19790515	19980331	 San Antonio, TX	 other	2 hours	in the backyard. I looked up and saw what I thought was a falling star.  It came to a stop and hovered.  Then it moved again. Then we noticed approximately 12-15 of these objects ( which looked like stars) moving across the sky.  We watched them for about two hours.It was mid-may, 1979.  I was in the backyard with my family, and I looked up to the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a falling star (meteor or meteorite) but contrary to the typical behavior of falling stars, this one came to a stop, and hovered.  It looked just like a star.  Then, to my surprise, another &quot;point of light&quot; moved across the path of the first object.  Altogether, my family and I watched 12-15 of these objects move around in the sky for approximately 2 hours.  We called my Aunt, who lived a couple of miles away, and told her to go outside and watch them.  She went outside, but was unable to see anything other than the normal night sky.  We called the police non-emergency number, and they said it was probably fireworks or airplanes. Please note: These objects were extremely high  in altitude and made no noise.  There were too many of them for them to be satellites. Later that summer, my mother was describing the incident to an old family friend ( a lutheran minister)  who lived in WIsconsin.  He told my mother that on that night he had been fishing on a lake in Wisconsin, and he had seen THE EXACT SAME THING.
19980326	19980502	 Westhampton, NY	 unknown	10 secs	Large, stationary object app. 100ft above ground, with lights					At about 9:30pm on 26th March I was driving east along Route 27 between exists 62 and 63 when I spotted a large object in the sky.  It was on the north side of the highway and appeared to be stationary.  I watched it as I drove for about 9 or 10 seconds, but it did not appear to move.  I asked my father, who was sitting in the passenger seat and was more familiar with the area what it was, and he said it looked like a UFO.  The object looked like a very large plane, with illuminated windows and some lights around the sides.  I could not make out the outline of the object, but it seemed to be somehat triangular.  It was about 100 feet off the ground and about double the size of a large aircraft.  It made no noise. When I returned to that spot in the daytime, I saw no structure that large that it could be.  The area is undeveloped and flat with no large structures of any kind except for two gas or water tanks about three quarters of a mile from the highway, but they had nothing that looked like windows and they were small and spherical.

We observed a target, unidentified, in Soviet airspace heading east at high speed. Our first thought was that it was some type of missile. We turned on the scope camera and notified the site commander. The object was estimated at 25000kt. The first contact was at about 200 miles, which would make it very high or very large.

Material did not look like metalThe craft moved very quickly through the sky, it looked nothing like an airplane, and moved too quickly to be one.  Although it did move quickly, it was easy to see the craft in detail.  After about 15 min .  of following the craft it was gone.  The craft did not come close to land, it remained high in the sky.  The craft looked like a disk with three to four poles comming out of the top.  It did not look like it was made out of metal, but some other almost cloud like material. The craft was white. I was not able to see the material it was made of easily, as it was high in the sky on a very sunny day.  I know more people saw this.  The beach was crowded and many people were looking at the craft. I am a student at a nearby university

At first it looked like a balloon in the far off distance, but then it just stopped and hovered.  I went downstairs to go outside and see it better.  I grabbed the binoculars and told my mom to come check it out. It started to move again to the  west, (coming from the north) in a straight line.  It then began to bob and weave in a way that no flying object I&apos;ve ever seen or heard of.  Through the binoculars it appeared to be very bright with a hint of a metallic, silver-type shade to it.  After about five minutes, we lost behind the clouds

THE TIME WAS ABOUT 9:45 AND WE NOTICED SOME PEOPLE LOOKING UP AT THE SKY. THROUGH THE SMOKE AND SOMEWHAT DIFFUSED BECAUSE OF IT, MY SON SPOTTED THE CLUSTERS OF GREEN AND RED LIGHTS. THEY NEVER WENT AWAY AND THEY SEEMED TO STAY IN ONE POSITION. I THINK MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS LEFT OVER FROM THE FIREWORKS, BUT THAT MAKES NO SENSE. I AND MY FAMILY WATCHED FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES, THE WALK ON TOWARD THE CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL AND STOPPED AND LOOKED AGAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE. THEN I SAW SOMETHING WHICH LOOKED LIKE A HUGE WING IN THE DARKNES, BUT NO BRIGHT LIGHTS OR CLEARANCE LIGHTS LIKE AN AIRCRAFT. IN FACT THERE SEEMED TO BE MULTIPLE LIGHTS, BUT DIM OUTLING A RECTANGULAR SWEPT WING SHAPE AND HUGE, I THOUGHT FIRST IT WAS A FLOCK OF GEESE OR DUCKS BUT THAT DIDN&apos;T MAKE SENSE AND IT MOVED SILENTLY FROM THE EASE SIDE  TO THE WEST UNTIL BEHIND THE BUILDINGS. THE RED AND GREENISH LIGHTS STILL REMAINED FOR ANOTHER 5 MINUTES MORE OR SO AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE CIRCUS CIRCUS THEY VANISHED. WE KNOW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SAW THIS PHENOMENOM, BUT NOT MANY PEOPLE REACTED LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT, I THINK PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE FIREWORK SHOW THAT JUST PRECEDED THE SIGHTING. I NEVER THOUGHT MORE ABOUT IT UNTIL I HEARD THE RADIO TONIGHT AND LISTENED TO THE ART BELL SHOW AND REALIZED MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE SAME OR SIMILAR SIGHTS. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING IF ANYONE ELSE SAW THIS IN THE AREA.
19700726	19980501	 Cottonwood (30 min.west of Sedona), AZ	 cylinder	1hr. 15 min.	My family and I were sitting on our front porch, faceing west about 10:30 p.m. As dusk was turning to night we abserved a bright light rise up over Mingus Mt. As it rose higher that light became so bright it illuminated the whole valley. And it just hovered there and didn&apos;t move at all. All we seemed to be able to do was watch, suddenly the light dimmed and the disk suddenly shot off to the north and two other lights joined the ffirst and all three shot off and disappeared. After that episode my sisters and I spent many nights in our sleeping bags watching for ufos. These were not weather balloones as we were told by the military and police. We have seen to many unexplainable things to fall for that lie. This was just one of many encounters we&apos;ve had. And I truly believe these vessels were not of this world, at this time we did not have the technology.
19980923	19980925	 Houston, TX	 fireball	4 seconds	I was at the Texaco gasoline loading rack on the north side of Houston. I was loading my truck, when i happened to look to the west and saw a very large and bright green fire ball streaking across the sky from east to west.When I saw the fireball, I first thought it was a meteor or something like that.  But after hearing you and Art Bell talk about all the others who had seen it as well I figured you might want to know about my sighting as well.
19980411	19980514	 Corralitos, CA	 other	6 seconds	An airbourne craft.An irregular triangle with rounded edges. Had an orange glow around it.Had 3 white lights along the bottom that illuminated the object,revealing a metalic extrerior.I was standing near the doorway of my house looking in a southeastern direction.The craft came into view and was moving in a east/west direction.It was an irregular triangle with rounded edges as seen from a side view.The bottom was 75 feet long whith 3 small white lights evenly spaced along its lenghth. The rear [ assumed by the direction of travel ] was 30 feet high and sloped at a 20 degree angle to the rounded top. &gt;From the top it sloped down at a 120 degree angle towards the rounded front end.It was 50 feet off the ground and was 150 feet away. It made no sound.It glowed orange around it&apos;s edges.It appeared to be mettalic in composition as reveald by the lights along the bottom I estimate its rate of travel to be upwards of 300mph. It flew between two trees that are 150 feet apart.From my view it flew first in front of one then behind the other.It continued on its way until it went behind a hillside. I am a 34 year old male.married.no childeren.a clerk in buisiness in downtown Santa cruz.People I&apos;ve talked to dont believe me.So now I keep my mouth shut.Hopefully you folks will feel differently. feel free to E-mail me.
19470714	19980924	 Syracuse, NY	 cigar	15 minutes	WHILE LOOKING OUT THE SECOND STORY WINDOW OF HIAWATHA COTTAGE AT ELMCREST CHILDREN&apos;S CENTER I SAW A BIG (200 FT.?) CIGAR SHAPED CRAFT OF BURNISHED METAL ABOVE THE LAST ROW OF TREES OF THE ORCHARD BEHIND THE COTTAGES. THE ORCHARD ENDED ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM THE COTTAGE. I HAD LEFT THE FIRST BASE OF THE SANDLOT GAME TO GO UP AND BRUSH MY TEETH. I WAS 13 YEARS OF AGE. I WOULDN&apos;T ORDINARILY LEAVE A BALL GAME TO BRUSH MY TEETH UNLESS FORCED BUT I WAS NOT FORCED OR SUGGESTED TO GO BY ANYONE THERE.THERE WERE NO LIGHTS OR WINDOWS OR OTHER MARKINGS. NO FINS OR CONTROL SURFACES. IT JUST HUNG SUSPENDE SILENTLY ABOVE THE TREES. I LATER SURMISED THAT THE OCCUPANTS MUST HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE GIANT HORSHOE SHAPE OF THE CHILDREN&apos;S CENTER WITH ITS 10 TWO STORY COTTAGES AROUND THE EDGE/ROAD AND ADMINISTRATION BUILDINGS AT THE CENTER OF THE SEMI RING AND THE GIANT PLAYGROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CURVE.... THE CHILDREN&apos;S CENTER IS STILL THERE AT 960 SALT SPRINGS ROAD.
19980601	19980603	 Denver, CO	 circle	4 seconds	I was looking towards the Mountains, west, when I saw a large bright golden circle shaped light raise from that area.  It went accross and over the sky while keeping the the approximate same distance from me.  It then flew over my building, and I could not view it any longer.  The distance was about half of the sky in less then 5 seconds time.  The shape or color or distance of the object did not change, nor did the way in which it was navigating.
19980923	19980924	 Everett, WA	 fireball	1 second	driving s. on I-5 by everett mall, saw green fire ball moving e-w at about 500-1000 feet. small object w&#x5C;tail moving very fast. expected to see an impact, but none notedlisting to art bell this evening, I thought WOW that was what I saw last night. being south bound on I5 at that time of night, there were a number of cars around me.
19980817	19980924	 North Plains, OR	 oval	3 min	color silver,oblong shape,distance about a mile away,it wobbled and that was how i saw it had no wings,moving west to east,100 feet highI just finished eating at mc donalds and as I was going out to my car I looked over the fields facing north,(it is a small rural town that has a clear view of the hills past the fields and the small town)and I noticed below the hill line a long (approx 30 to 50 ft)silver object moving west to east. I watched it thinking it was a very slow moving plane at first, then I noticed the wobble, moving north to south, or away from me to towards me.it was then that I realised that it was moving very slow, because of the distance bieng so close I guessed the speed to be about 5 MPH.I started looking real close at this time and I saw no wings no tail and no windows, it moved from left to right very slowly wabeling the intire time, it then moved behind some tree&apos;s and I walked over to get a better view and when I got to a place where I should have seen it, it was gone.I then went to work (my workplace bieng only across the street and talked with a co-worker, he has lived in north plains for 20+ years and is a pilet that owns his own plane. I asked bill if anyone ownes any blimps or such an aircraft that fit the discription that I have previosly given by any strech of his imagination.he said no, and I asked him where the local airports are and they are south from our location. I am a machinist and have been for the last three and one half years.
19970704	19980321	 Auburn, WA	 triangle	1 minute	we were outside lighting fireworks when way up in the sky we saw a triangular shaped &quot;thing&quot; that had lights. It was going very very slow almost hovering.We were out side lighting fireworks when way up in the sky we saw what looked like a triangular shaped ship. It had bright blue and red lights and it was moving very slowly. So slowly that it seemed to be hovering. My daughter and I saw it. It was like nothing I had ever seen but my husband thinks it was an airplane. It was also completely quiet.
19620601	19980404	 Liberty Homes (near Charleston), SC	 sphere	15-20 MIN.	I saw a circular object with lights going around the middle of it.I was about 5 or 6 years old and it was around lunch because my mother was making a egg salad sandwich.  I was on the front porch eating a Kool-Aid pack with my fingers when I looked up and saw a circular object with orange lights blinking.  The lights were around the middle.  It was stationary and never moved from the position it was in.  But thinking this was something I never saw before wanted to show my mother.  I called her and she came out. She looked up but couldn&apos;t see it and as I pointed up to show her where it was it just disapeared.  She went back in to finish lunch.  I was surprised that it was gone and then started to feel sick to my stomach.  Thinking it was the Kool-Aid I threw it down and then started to feel dizzy so went to bed.  That night my parents had to take me to the emergency room because I had hemoraged all over my pillow.  The emergency room doctors said my tonsils had ruptured.  I was spitting up chunks of blood.  I remember thinking that the doctor was dumb because at the time I thought it was really the kool-aid.  It wasn&apos;t until marriage and kids later that I recalled that event and wondered more about it.
19980305	19980309	 Norfolk, VA	 fireball	3  seconds	Intensely bright green fireball almost the diameter of the moon shot across the sky.  Long bright green trail.  Visible for 3 seconds or lessWas getting out of my truck on Boissevain Avenue in Norfolk, Va. and was facing North when the event occured.  Saw the brightest object I have ever seen in the sky except for the sun.  It was a bright green fireball with a tail that was extremely long of the same color. I have seen many meteors/meteorites in my 50 years but never anything to equal this.  It was a dark evening and I was on a well lit city street.  Will send you a sketch if desired.
19980508	19980510	 Pompano Beach, FL	 triangle	15 min.	At night looked like rocket with bright tail launched 200 miles north near NASA but in 7 minutes it was above us.  Front nose with bright light, twin flaming tail lights, no noise, very large size, no strobes or colors. Hovering past no visable body only 3 lights to judge size.  Went slow into night sky. After gone, 2 white lights (jets?) came from over ocean to catch up with it then all disappeared.((Deleted))@aol.com
19730801	19980128	 Kittery, ME	 formation	10 Seconds	Summary : A VERY fast light point object that was viewed for about 10 Seconds.I was standing topside watch aboard the USS Will Rogers (SSBN 659) with another petty officer named Duncan (can&apos;t remember last name). We witnessed a VERY fast brilliant object moving across the sky behind the lights of Portsmouth, NH and head out to sea (the Atlantic). Within two or three minutes after the sighting, we witnessed a flight of four F-15&apos;s take off from Pease AFB on full AB. They proceeded in the same direction of the object. Thinking this was significant, we made a note in the topside log and notified Pease AFB operations that we could confirm the sighting. The next morning the ship&apos;s XO called us in and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to play games with the Air Force and were then ordered to ammend our logbook entry. We were used to seeing F-15&apos;s take off from Pease during day and night. The object was many times faster than an F-15. It also did not in any way fit the profile of an F-15&apos;s afterburners. All we saw was a point of light moving very fast out to sea. This incident has remained a question in my mind because of the reverberations it caused in the Navy and Air Force chains of command.
19971015	19980113	 Atlanta (north of), GA	 light	5 min	Summary : A  blue grayish kind of light.It was sometime in October when I spent the night at a friends house. Sometime in the early morning hours, I had awakened and looked out the window and saw this blue-gray light that had the apperance of drifting. (No unusual noise at all.) The diamater of this light looked to be the same as a pencil. I could not see a beam of anykind, but when  I started to get up to investigate, the light turned towards me (Clockwise looking down.) and shined in my right eye. The light was not like any I have seen before. It wasn&apos;t like a doctor&apos;s pen light, the light did not cause me to squint. The light didn&apos;t have to search for my eye, it went right to in a fraction of a second. Looking into the light, I could not see around the edges and in some way it reminded of chalk. The best I can remember, I only looked at the light about 1 second. Next thing I remembered, I didn&apos;t want to get up and go to the window anymore to investigate what was out there. That isn&apos;t like me, I am the type that would be the first one there, but after the light, I kept on  thinking to myself &quot;I can get up and look, but I don&apos;t want to.&quot; I didn&apos;t at that time felt that I was held back in any way. BTW, I didn&apos;t see any kind of craft.
19661001	19980924	 Edmonton (30 mi. east of, Hwy 16 East) (Canada), AB	 diamond	5 min	Unusual ights in distance. Approached until object overhead as wide as road and ditch. Bright lights, Turned head to find object in horizon. in horizon.On Labor Day, 1966 we were travelling to Saskatchewan for the holiday on Hwy 16 E about 30 miles out of town. My husband, myself, son almost two and I was pregnant.  Ahead we saw bright lights.  Since the road was straight, it was unusual.  We thought maybe a helecopter.  We slowed down and approached the lights.  As we got closer, we realized this object was very large and could not be anything we recognized.  We were going very slow as we approached this object.  It was very large.  It was as wide as a two lane highway with a curb and the ditch as well.  There were three rows of lights, the red being the most prominant.  We were calm and not frightned by this.  I was sitting up and looking up through the wind shield right under it and it was huge.  I told my husband to stop the car which he did.  I jumped out of the car, looked up and it was gone, and I could barely see it in the horizon.  The colors of the lights are vague, perhaps yellow or white, and green or blue.  The only sure color was red, for it seemed to be pulsing.  There were maybe 6 to 8 ports with lights in each color and 3 rows.  Less Rows on top to make the shape.  The lights were the only thing that gave it shape.  Like an upside down bowl. We continued on to Saskatchewan and mentioned it to my father and he had just read a book on UFO&apos;s and said it sounded like one.  I had never heard of such a thing.  Upon returning home to Alberta we ceased to talk about it, not to anyone, until one night a few months later, we had company, and we both realized that we had not told a sole.  So, we did.  Not long after this, both my husband and I were awoke in the middle of the night by a white light.  The house was light up like a flourescent light.  We lived by Half Moon Lake, and looked out to see what it could be.  There was a full moon that night, and the moon was reflecting on the lake.  The reflection of the moon was clear because it was a bit yellow, but there was another reflection, coming from where???  We phoned the Planitorium the next day to see if there had been a meterorite that night and they said no.  It was a frightning night!  After that, we basically left the experience alone.  I was due to have my baby in January, and while I was having her, I had a dream where I went some where.  It was so clear. There was someone talking to me and telling me why I had to go back. The doctors thought I may have had a near death experience, but I some- times wonder if it may have been from that experience.  I did go to a doctor and went under Hypnosis but nothing.  I always had the feeling that there had been more to this sighting that just seeing it. Myself and my two children all have Auto Immune diseases, myself, Multiple Sclerosis, My son, Chrones Disease and my Daughter a very serious Ulcerative Colitis. My daughter is a teacher, my son an Instrumentation Engineer and have done well academically.  I am unable to work.  This experience has never left my mind, and I am now living in the country and am always scared.  Jokingly I will say to my husband that I am sure in a good place for them to come at any time and check me out.  From my childhood, I have a good memory of an incident where I thought a &quot;Piece fell out of the Sky&quot; I wrote it down on a piece of paper and said I would retrieve it when I was a big girl and then people would believe me.  This is the first time I have told the Story and thought that it should be recorded some where.  I have since been divorced from the person driving the car, and have checked with him on different occasions to verify that it really did happen.  Another interesting thought was that at the time of the siting, we were not afraid at all. Also, when we were under it, I had my window opened, and there was not a sound.
19980311	19980311	 Colorado Springs, CO	 other	10-15 sec.	Seven narrow cylinders with tapered ends, flew in silent formation, from the south,due north. They appeared to have no single light. They glowed.On 3/11/98 at 10:03pm cst, my wife and myself were standing in our back(south-facing)yard, in the southwest side of Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was clear, moon nearly full, calm wind, 20 degrees. I looked to the west at about 30 degrees above the horizon at a group of stars to the north of Orion. As I turned back to face my wife something caught my attention inn the corner of my eye. I thought that it was a star cluster I had at first overlooked yet, there seemed to be movement. I turned to the west to squarely look at the object and discovered it to be moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude, from south to north. A path which came directly over Cheyenne Mountain and continued along the front range mountains until I could not see it any longer due to houses, etc.. When I first noticed that it was a moving object, I brought it to my wife&apos;s attention. She too percieved the same U.F.O.. At first sight it appeared to be a single chevron or delta winged configuration. However,the object consisted of seven cylindrical sections. Each cylinder tapered to nearly a point on each end. One in the lead with three others on each side. They were of a consistant grayish tone with perhaps a slight aura around each one. It was impossible to estimate the size or speed. First impressions were of a craft the size of a B-52 at about 5,000 feet, cruising at a speed consistant with approaching an airport for landing. Although, it easily could have been much larger and at considerably higher altitude. It was completely silent. There were no external lights. Preconceptions of aircraft flying with their wings perpendicular to the ground, at first, gave the impression that this was also true for this group of objects. Although it may have been a formation stacked vertically. I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m suggesting this because of the moon light at the time. The color of the objects were consistent with moon glow reflection. A reflection which seems unlikely if the craft were side by side with one another. The overall shape of the seven objects appeared to have little or no foreshortening, which I would expect from the angle,if they were flying horizontal, side by side. I don&apos;t know. The entire event was 10-15 seconds long. At about 6 seconds into the event, the upper or eastern three objects broke formation for about 1 to 2 seconds before regrouping as they origonally were. The break in formation was rather wave-like in it&apos;s movement. The first object from the middle, moved first, away from the center object and slightly forward. With the next two objects moving outward slightly. And the outer- most object moving slightly further apart still. Then they all reversed the sequence to resume the original formation. At this moment, the objects involved in the laterral motion, appeared to have their aura&apos;s glow intensify for less than a second, then return to the same overall color. Then they went out of sight, due to houses, trees, etc..
19670701	19980112	 East Hanover, NJ	 cigar	aprox.10min	Summary : no moon,observed colored blinking lights apox.     150&apos; up in southern sky.lights appeared to be from port holes, dark showded images peered out, moving about..was cigar shaped, 50&apos; long. objected hovered stationary for a few moments than moved very slowly to the west. i followed in my car(a 1960 Falcon). after 1/4 mile UFO hovered stationary again for a moment then shot straight up to the south. i never reported this, but i do remmber other sightings being reported in mid and late 60&apos;s.
19960720	19980222	 Moncton (Canada), NB	 rectangle	60 seconds	It flow over the woods north of my house, slowly came towards the house, that night there was a meteor shower , thats what I thought it was, until my father said someting about it, we watched it for about 10 seconds and at that point it was completely over us, it was all black and it was very large, about the size of two football fields, once it got past our house it spead up and flow to the right and disappeared. That was the last that I saw of it.
19980923	19980923	 Vancouver, WA	 fireball	5 seconds	A 5 second slow 60 degree arc of light; slower &amp; brighter greenish glow toward end of arc traveling east to west.My wife and I were sitting in our hot tub Wednesday evening as we often do.  We have spent many hours out there in the evenings observing the high altitude jets on their way to Seattle; and counting satellites as they orbit and the occasional metorite.  I mention this only to indicate that we are very familar with the normal nighttime sky activity. At approximately 9:10PM, I interrupted our conversation, pointed at the sky and said WHOA!.....WHOA!......WHOA!......WHOA! as I tracked the light across the sky.  It is my exclamations that now help me estimate the time duration of the event.  In this time it traveled from the east to the west in about a 60 degree arc until it passed behind a tree.  I also estimate the angle from the horizon was about 60 degrees to the south of our location in Cascade Park, Vancouver, WA. Some things I noticed most unusual:  The speed slowed and became brighter toward the end of my vision, glowing a bright greenish blue.  The size of the fireball seemed larger at the end, about the size of  a baseball in the air at 30 feet.  Also, even from the beginning of the arc the speed of this object was much slower than and metorite I have ever  observed and we did enjoy the recent summer meteor showers.

19970610	19980408	 Louisville (directly over metropolitan area), KY	 other	40 seconds	I was riding parallel to downtown Louisville on the Indiana side of the Ohio river. Was In &quot;Floyds knobs&quot; in New Albany, Ind....looking South-South west. I was in the passenger side of the vehicle facing above direction.  My friend was driving. Floyds Knobs provides an optimum view of the city skyline and is a favored area for such viewing.I glanced skyward and observed a &quot;streaking&quot; object rapidly advancing West to East over the city. The object was of the intensity of an atypical star. perhaps indicative of its distance. Having taken astronomy in college it was certainly NOT a comet, incoming asteroid or other debris. The object when DIRECTLY over the city released an apparent projectile.  Both objects were white in color. the secondary object &quot;streaked&quot; On an apparent trajectory towards the city itself. The object secondary object dissapeared from view when it was washed out by the city lights below. The initial primary object continued rapidly in a westerly direction eventually fading from view.I am a full time college student . My companion at he time is as well.
19841215	19980331	 Santiago (Chile),	 changing	30 min.	First: One Object, Second: Few colorfull objects, Final: Again One objectReturning from a trip, we were near Santiago (a the east): Suddenly we saw a object looking to the west. It was a little white but brilliant point. It moved fast great distances (about 2 kilometers) to the north, south and again to the original position, maintaining the altitude. Suddenly it exploded showing a lot of coloful lights (red, blue, yellow dots). Some minutes after that it was again only one object like at first. The sight was at night so the light were well seen. The distance between us and the object was maybe approx. 5 to 10 kilometers. At the end the object appeared to flight towards us, so all of us were exited and more or less frightened. Finally the object made a fast change of trayectory and dissapeared.
19980526	19980602	 Denver (downtown), CO	 teardrop	15 seconds	I looked out and noticed waht appeared to be 2 Teardrop shaped balloons linked by a tether to one another, Metallic, shiny. The motion made when in flight was tandem. Could have been Weather balloons except for the fact they where moving against the prevailing winds 25/30 mph winds that day I bet. Lasted only a few seconds untill they moved behind cloud cover.Same as brief summary.. there wasn&apos;t much to it other than the fact they where not aircraft. they looked like this (&gt;-----&lt;) and moved in tandem ( like when you would spin a dumbell) one side is always opposite the other. The main action that made me believe this thing was unusual was A. It&apos;s appearance B. it&apos;s movement against the Wind.
19961020	19980217	 Odessa, TX	 diamond	5 minutes	Driving down busy street at night, quarter of mile or so, thought we saw several helicopters in sky.  Drove right up to it and under it.  Got out of van and discussed what we were seeing.  Huge diamond shape with brightest strobing white lights I had ever seen, very low to ground, hovering over neighborhood, no sound.  Clearly saw underneath writing or something all under.  Airplane came and ufo streaked off .  Estimated to be 150ftx150ft. , this may be vast underestimation.  No reports.  No radar.  It was huge.  We had plenty of time to examine it.I am a believer and have had one other encounter of disconnected balls of lights examining the car I was in with 3 other people.  My mother on the other hand is a devout disbeliever.  My sanity is intact because she was with me.  The object appeared to be charcoal gray, square or diamond shaped with blinding white strobe lights at the points.  No other colors were observed.  There was a distinct writing or something underneath in circles that covered the bottom.  When we first saw it it was traveling east to west seemingly down a busy street.  It got off the street and turned north and just stopped as if to let us look at it.  It just hovered over a populated neighborhood not doing anything.  It seemed to be about 50 ft. above the houses, very low.  It was huge.  We discussed wondering how such a thing could fly.  From the direction of the airport (east) we saw a very fast flying airplane coming our way.  The thing took off at a high rate of speed north and we gave chase along with the airplane.  We kept it in sight for another 6 miles and then lost it.  I called the airport to ask if anything had been reported and they said no.  I have searched everywhere and cannot find a picture of this thing and wonder if anyone else has seen this particular one.  It took so long to report because I didn&apos;t know where and got my computer for Christmas.
19980416	19980417	 Lafayette/Moraga (Between), CA	 fireball	flash	Unusually bright meteor/re-entry eventWhile travelling along a very dark and wooded road, I observed the flash of a meteor-like object in a clearing between some trees.  The object was bluish-white in color.  It gave the impression of being somewhat fuzzy and indistinct in shape - like a meteor but definately NOT an aircraft.  It&apos;s magnitude was much brighter than an aircraft&apos;s strobe light (x3).  The object was descending (rapidly).  It was observed to the west of my location (towards San Francisco).
19980923	19980923	 San Fernando Valley, CA	 other	3 seconds	I was driving north on the Ventura Freeway(101 Freeway). Off to the north east I saw a very thin blueish streak moving slowly towards the north. It was on the absolute horizon and was extremely faint. Meaning whatever it was was far away. Lasted only a few seconds. Didn&apos;t think much of it until I heard your report on The Art Bell Show this evening. Hope this helps.
